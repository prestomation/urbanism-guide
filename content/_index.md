# Seattle Urbanism Guide

**Ever been to a city meeting where everyone seemed to speak a different language?** This guide is the dictionary -- and the map. Whether you care about housing costs, bus routes, bike lanes, or your neighborhood's future, start here.

Seattle is changing fast -- new transit lines, zoning reforms, housing policy -- and it can be hard to know where to jump in. This guide exists so that when you show up to a community meeting, open house, or public comment period, you can follow the conversation and contribute meaningfully.

## Who this is for

- You've been to a community meeting and felt like everyone else knew something you didn't
- You care about housing, transit, or walkability but feel lost in the jargon
- You want to get involved in Seattle's future but aren't sure where to start

## New here? Three steps to get started

1. **[Read the Quick Start](/quick-start/)** -- understand who runs what and what the big debates are
2. **[Browse the Glossary](/glossary/)** -- look up terms like ADU, SEPA, and MHA in plain language
3. **[Pick a topic guide](/guides/)** -- dive deep on the issue you care about most
