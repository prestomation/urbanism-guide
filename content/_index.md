# Seattle Urbanism Guide

**A practical guide for people who want to make Seattle a better place to live, move, and grow.**

Seattle is changing fast. New transit lines, zoning reforms, bike lanes, housing policy -- there's a lot happening, and it can be hard to know where to start. This guide exists so that when you show up to a community meeting, open house, or public comment period, you can actually follow the conversation and contribute meaningfully.

## Who this is for

- You just moved to Seattle and want to understand how the city works
- You care about housing, transit, or walkability but feel lost in the jargon
- You want to get involved but don't know where to start
- You've been to a community meeting and felt like everyone else knew something you didn't

## What this is *not*

This isn't a news source (see [Recommended Reading](/recommended-reading/) for those). It's not an advocacy org (see [Get Involved](/get-involved/) for those). This is a **reference guide** -- a place to build your understanding so you can engage with those resources and your community more effectively.
