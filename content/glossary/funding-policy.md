# Funding & Policy Terms

## Impact Fees

One-time charges on new development to pay for infrastructure (roads, parks, schools) needed to serve new residents. Seattle has been slow to adopt impact fees compared to other cities.

**Why it matters:** Impact fees are a perpetual debate in Seattle. Developers argue they raise housing costs. Advocates say new development should pay for the infrastructure it requires. Whether and how Seattle implements impact fees affects both housing affordability and public services.

## MFTE (Multifamily Tax Exemption)

A city program that gives property tax breaks to developers who include affordable units in new apartment buildings. The tax exemption lasts 12 years.

**Why it matters:** MFTE is one of Seattle's main tools for getting affordable units built in market-rate projects. When MFTE buildings' exemptions expire, those affordable units can go to market rate -- creating a slow-motion affordability cliff.

## Move Seattle Levy

A 9-year, $930 million property tax levy (2015-2024) funding transportation projects including bus speed improvements, bike lanes, bridge maintenance, and sidewalk repairs. Succeeded by a new levy proposal.

**Why it matters:** Transportation levies are how Seattle funds most of its street and transit improvements. Understanding levy cycles helps you know when to advocate for specific projects and how they're funded.

## REET (Real Estate Excise Tax)

A tax on property sales that funds affordable housing, parks, and infrastructure. Washington recently gave cities more flexibility to use REET funds for affordable housing.

**Why it matters:** REET is a significant funding source for affordable housing in Seattle. Changes to how REET revenue can be used directly affect the city's ability to build and preserve affordable units.

## TIF (Tax Increment Financing)

A financing tool where future property tax increases in a designated area are used to pay for current infrastructure investments in that area. Washington authorized TIF in 2021 (HB 1189, codified as chapter 39.114 RCW), making it available to cities, counties, and port districts.

**Why it matters:** TIF was authorized in Washington in 2021 (HB 1189) and is now available to cities, counties, and port districts. As Seattle plans development around new light rail stations, TIF could become a significant tool for funding the infrastructure needed to support transit-oriented communities.
