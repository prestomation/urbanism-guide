# Funding & Policy Terms

## Impact Fees

One-time charges on new development to pay for infrastructure (roads, parks, schools) needed to serve new residents. Seattle has been slow to adopt impact fees compared to other cities.

**Why it matters:** Impact fees are a perpetual debate in Seattle. Developers argue they raise housing costs. Advocates say new development should pay for the infrastructure it requires. Whether and how Seattle implements impact fees affects both housing affordability and public services.

## MFTE (Multifamily Tax Exemption)

A city program that gives property tax breaks to developers who include affordable units in new apartment buildings. The tax exemption lasts 12 years.

**Why it matters:** MFTE is one of Seattle's main tools for getting affordable units built in market-rate projects. When MFTE buildings' exemptions expire, those affordable units can go to market rate -- creating a slow-motion affordability cliff.

## Move Seattle Levy

A 9-year, $930 million property tax levy (2015-2024) funding transportation projects including bus speed improvements, bike lanes, bridge maintenance, and sidewalk repairs. Succeeded by a new levy proposal.

**Why it matters:** Transportation levies are how Seattle funds most of its street and transit improvements. Understanding levy cycles helps you know when to advocate for specific projects and how they're funded.

---

## REET (Real Estate Excise Tax)

A tax on property sales that funds affordable housing, parks, and infrastructure. Washington recently gave cities more flexibility to use REET funds for affordable housing.

**Why it matters:** REET is a significant funding source for affordable housing in Seattle. Changes to how REET revenue can be used directly affect the city's ability to build and preserve affordable units.

---

## TIF (Tax Increment Financing)

A financing tool where future property tax increases in a designated area are used to pay for current infrastructure investments in that area. Not currently authorized in Washington state, though there have been legislative efforts to enable it.

**Why it matters:** TIF is widely used in other states to fund transit-oriented development, affordable housing, and infrastructure. Whether Washington enables TIF could significantly affect how Seattle funds development around new light rail stations.
