# Housing & Zoning Terms

## ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit)

A smaller, secondary home on the same lot as a main house. Think backyard cottages or basement apartments. Seattle has been loosening ADU rules since 2019 to allow more housing in single-family zones.

**Why it matters:** ADUs are one of the gentlest ways to add housing in existing neighborhoods without changing their character dramatically. They're a key part of Seattle's strategy to add "missing middle" housing.

## DADU (Detached Accessory Dwelling Unit)

An ADU that's a separate structure from the main house -- typically a backyard cottage. As of 2019, Seattle allows both an attached ADU and a DADU on most single-family lots.

## FAR (Floor Area Ratio)

The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of its lot. A FAR of 1.0 means you can build total floor space equal to the lot size (e.g., a one-story building covering the whole lot, or a two-story building covering half). Higher FAR = denser development allowed.

**Why it matters:** FAR limits are one of the main tools the city uses to control how big buildings can be in different zones. When people talk about "upzoning," they often mean increasing the allowed FAR.

## MHA (Mandatory Housing Affordability)

Seattle's program requiring developers of commercial and multifamily buildings to include affordable units or pay into a fund for affordable housing. Passed in 2019 alongside upzones in many neighborhoods.

**Why it matters:** MHA is Seattle's main mechanism for connecting new development to affordable housing production. It's controversial -- developers say it raises costs; advocates say it doesn't go far enough.

## Missing Middle Housing

Housing types between single-family homes and large apartment buildings: duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses, courtyard apartments. Historically banned in most Seattle residential zones.

**Why it matters:** Seattle's 2024 comprehensive plan update and related zoning changes are opening up much of the city to missing middle housing for the first time in decades. This is one of the biggest zoning shifts in the city's history.

## Single-Family Zoning

Zoning that only allows one house per lot. Seattle had roughly 75% of its residential land zoned single-family until recent reforms. The city has been gradually renaming and reforming these zones (now called "Neighborhood Residential") to allow more housing types.

**Why it matters:** Single-family zoning is the legacy framework that restricted density across most of Seattle. Understanding it is key to understanding why housing is so expensive and why reform is contentious.

## Upzoning

Changing zoning rules to allow larger or denser buildings than previously permitted. Can mean increasing building height limits, FAR, or allowed unit counts.

**Why it matters:** Upzoning is one of the most debated topics in Seattle land use. Proponents say it's essential for housing affordability and climate goals. Opponents worry about neighborhood character, displacement, and infrastructure strain.

**See also:** FAR, MHA, Single-Family Zoning

## Affordable Housing

Housing where residents pay no more than 30% of their income on rent/mortgage. In Seattle policy, "affordable" usually means affordable to households earning a percentage of Area Median Income (AMI) -- often 60% or 80% AMI.

**Why it matters:** Seattle's AMI is high (~$120k for a family of four), so "affordable at 80% AMI" still means rents that many people can't afford. Understanding the AMI benchmarks helps you evaluate whether affordable housing proposals will actually serve the people who need them.
