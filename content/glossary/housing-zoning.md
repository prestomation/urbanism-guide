# Housing & Zoning Terms

## ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit)

A smaller, secondary home on the same lot as a main house. Think backyard cottages or basement apartments. Seattle has been loosening ADU rules since 2019 to allow more housing in single-family zones.

**Why it matters:** ADUs are one of the gentlest ways to add housing in existing neighborhoods without changing their character dramatically. They're a key part of Seattle's strategy to add "missing middle" housing.

---

## Design Review

A public process where volunteer boards and city staff evaluate the design of proposed multifamily and commercial buildings. Seattle has eight geographic design review boards that hold public meetings to review projects exceeding certain size thresholds.

**Why it matters:** Design review can add 1-2 years to project timelines and significantly affect housing costs. The process gives neighbors a voice in shaping development but has been criticized for delays and subjectivity. Washington's HB 1293 (2025) requires "clear and objective" design standards, forcing Seattle to overhaul its program.

---

## Displacement

The involuntary movement of residents from their homes or neighborhoods due to rising costs, redevelopment, or other economic pressures. Often disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color.

**Why it matters:** Displacement is the central equity concern in Seattle planning debates. The city's rapid growth has pushed many long-time residents out of neighborhoods like the Central District and Chinatown-International District. Anti-displacement strategies -- from community land trusts to tenant protections -- are now required elements of comprehensive planning.

---

## DADU (Detached Accessory Dwelling Unit)

An ADU that's a separate structure from the main house -- typically a backyard cottage. As of 2019, Seattle allows both an attached ADU and a DADU on most single-family lots.

---

## FAR (Floor Area Ratio)

The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of its lot. A FAR of 1.0 means you can build total floor space equal to the lot size (e.g., a one-story building covering the whole lot, or a two-story building covering half). Higher FAR = denser development allowed.

**Why it matters:** FAR limits are one of the main tools the city uses to control how big buildings can be in different zones. When people talk about "upzoning," they often mean increasing the allowed FAR.

---

## Grand Bargain

The 2015 agreement between Seattle developers, affordable housing advocates, and labor groups that created the framework for Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA). Developers agreed not to oppose inclusionary zoning requirements in exchange for upzones allowing additional building height and density.

**Why it matters:** The Grand Bargain was a pivotal political compromise that shaped Seattle's housing policy for a decade. Understanding it explains why MHA exists, why certain neighborhoods got upzoned, and why affordable housing requirements were set at specific levels (5-7% of units or in-lieu fees).

---

## HALA (Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda)

Seattle's 2015 comprehensive housing policy framework, developed by a 28-member advisory committee convened by Mayor Ed Murray. HALA produced 65 recommendations aimed at creating 50,000 new housing units over 10 years, including 20,000 affordable units.

**Why it matters:** HALA was the most significant housing policy initiative in Seattle's recent history. It created MHA, reformed ADU rules, expanded urban villages, and set the stage for current zoning debates. Many of today's housing policies trace directly back to HALA recommendations.

## HB 1110

Washington's 2023 statewide middle housing law requiring cities to allow duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and other "missing middle" housing types in residential neighborhoods. Larger cities near transit must allow up to six units per lot.

**Why it matters:** HB 1110 is a watershed moment for Washington zoning. It overrides local single-family zoning restrictions that have limited housing supply for decades. Seattle had to comply by June 2025, leading to the city's biggest zoning overhaul since the 1990s. The law fundamentally changes what can be built in formerly single-family neighborhoods.

---

## Lot Coverage

The percentage of a lot that can be covered by buildings and structures. Seattle's neighborhood residential zones typically have lot coverage limits of 35-50% depending on the zone and housing type.

**Why it matters:** Lot coverage limits, along with setbacks and height limits, determine how much building can fit on a site. When you hear debates about building "too big" for a lot, lot coverage is often part of the equation. Recent zoning changes have adjusted lot coverage rules to accommodate middle housing.

---

## MHA (Mandatory Housing Affordability)

Seattle's program requiring developers of commercial and multifamily buildings to include affordable units or pay into a fund for affordable housing. Passed in 2019 alongside upzones in many neighborhoods.

**Why it matters:** MHA is Seattle's main mechanism for connecting new development to affordable housing production. It's controversial -- developers say it raises costs; advocates say it doesn't go far enough.

---

## Missing Middle Housing

Housing types between single-family homes and large apartment buildings: duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses, courtyard apartments. Historically banned in most Seattle residential zones.

**Why it matters:** Seattle's 2024 comprehensive plan update and related zoning changes are opening up much of the city to missing middle housing for the first time in decades. This is one of the biggest zoning shifts in the city's history.

---

## Neighborhood Residential (NR)

Seattle's new zoning designation that replaced "single-family" zones in 2021. NR zones (NR1, NR2, NR3) now allow various housing types including duplexes, triplexes, and other middle housing following HB 1110 implementation.

**Why it matters:** The name change was initially symbolic, but NR zones now permit significantly more housing than old single-family zones. NR1 allows the most density (smallest minimum lot sizes), while NR3 is the least dense. Understanding NR zoning is essential for following current development patterns and zoning debates.

---

## Parking Minimums

Zoning rules that require developers to build a minimum number of off-street parking spaces. Seattle eliminated parking minimums near frequent transit in 2012 and expanded reforms in 2018, but requirements remain in lower-density neighborhoods.

**Why it matters:** Parking minimums add significant costs to housing construction (roughly $30,000-$50,000 per space for structured parking). Studies found Seattle's 2012 reforms resulted in 18,000 fewer spaces built, saving over $500 million. Washington's 2025 parking reform law (SB 5184) now caps how much parking cities can mandate statewide.

---

## Setbacks

Required distances between buildings and lot lines (front, side, and rear). Seattle's neighborhood residential zones typically require 20-foot front setbacks, 5-foot side setbacks, and rear setbacks of 20% of lot depth or 25 feet (whichever is less).

**Why it matters:** Setbacks, along with lot coverage and height limits, determine where and how big you can build on a lot. Recent zoning reforms have adjusted setbacks to make middle housing more feasible -- for example, reducing front setbacks to allow "Seattle Six" configurations with stoops and covered porches.

---

## Single-Family Zoning

Zoning that only allows one house per lot. Seattle had roughly 75% of its residential land zoned single-family until recent reforms. The city has been gradually renaming and reforming these zones (now called "Neighborhood Residential") to allow more housing types.

**Why it matters:** Single-family zoning is the legacy framework that restricted density across most of Seattle. Understanding it is key to understanding why housing is so expensive and why reform is contentious.

---

## Upzoning

Changing zoning rules to allow larger or denser buildings than previously permitted. Can mean increasing building height limits, FAR, or allowed unit counts.

**Why it matters:** Upzoning is one of the most debated topics in Seattle land use. Proponents say it's essential for housing affordability and climate goals. Opponents worry about neighborhood character, displacement, and infrastructure strain.

---

## Affordable Housing

Housing where residents pay no more than 30% of their income on rent/mortgage. In Seattle policy, "affordable" usually means affordable to households earning a percentage of Area Median Income (AMI) -- often 60% or 80% AMI.

**Why it matters:** Seattle's AMI is high (~$120k for a family of four), so "affordable at 80% AMI" still means rents that many people can't afford. Understanding the AMI benchmarks helps you evaluate whether affordable housing proposals will actually serve the people who need them.
