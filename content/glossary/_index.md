# Urbanism Glossary

Plain-language definitions of terms you'll hear at community meetings, in city council sessions, and in urbanist media. If you've ever nodded along while someone talked about "FAR" or "SEPA" and had no idea what they meant -- this is for you.

Terms are grouped by topic. Each entry tries to explain not just *what* a term means but *why it matters* in Seattle.

## How to use this glossary
