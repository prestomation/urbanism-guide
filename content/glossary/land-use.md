# Land Use & Planning Terms

## Comprehensive Plan

A city's long-range plan for growth, land use, transportation, parks, and utilities. Required by Washington's Growth Management Act. Seattle's comp plan is updated on major cycles (most recently 2024) and guides zoning and investment decisions for 20+ years.

**Why it matters:** The comprehensive plan is the single most important policy document for Seattle's future. It determines where growth goes, what gets built, and how the city invests. The 2024 update was a major battleground over density, equity, and neighborhood change.

## EIS (Environmental Impact Statement)

A detailed study of a project's or plan's environmental effects, required under SEPA for major actions. Covers traffic, noise, shadow, displacement, and more.

**Why it matters:** EIS processes can add years and millions of dollars to projects. They're an important environmental protection but also get used strategically to delay development or infrastructure. Understanding when an EIS is required helps you follow major project timelines.

## GMA (Growth Management Act)

Washington state law (1990) requiring urban areas to plan for growth, protect rural land, and provide infrastructure. Mandates comprehensive plans and urban growth boundaries.

**Why it matters:** The GMA is *why* Seattle has to plan for growth rather than sprawling indefinitely. It's the legal framework behind comprehensive plans, urban growth boundaries, and concurrency requirements. Recent GMA updates have pushed cities toward more housing production.

## SEPA (State Environmental Policy Act)

Washington's environmental review law. Requires government agencies to evaluate environmental impacts before approving projects, plans, or permits.

**Why it matters:** SEPA review is a common step in development and planning that can significantly affect timelines. It's also a tool that community members can use to raise concerns about projects. Knowing what SEPA covers helps you participate meaningfully in public comment periods.

## Urban Growth Boundary (UGB)

A line on the map separating urban areas (where growth is directed) from rural areas (which are preserved). King County's UGB limits sprawl and concentrates development.

**Why it matters:** The UGB is why Seattle *must* grow up rather than out. It's one of the strongest anti-sprawl tools in the country and directly drives the density debates within city limits.

## Urban Village

Seattle's planning designation for neighborhood centers that are targeted for growth. Includes hubs like Capitol Hill, the U-District, and Ballard, as well as smaller "residential urban villages." Created in the 1994 comprehensive plan.

**Why it matters:** Urban villages have been the framework for where Seattle directs growth for 30 years. The 2024 comp plan update is shifting away from this model toward more distributed growth, which is a significant conceptual change.

## Zoning

Government rules that dictate what can be built where -- building height, density, use (residential, commercial, industrial), setbacks, lot coverage, etc.

**Why it matters:** Zoning is the fundamental tool that shapes what Seattle looks like. Almost every land use debate comes down to zoning. If you understand zoning basics, you can follow most development controversies.
