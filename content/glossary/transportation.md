# Transportation Terms

## Complete Streets

A street design approach that considers all users -- pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and drivers -- not just cars. May include wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, bus-only lanes, and traffic calming.

**Why it matters:** Seattle adopted a Complete Streets policy, and it shapes how SDOT designs road projects. When a street gets rebuilt, advocates can push for complete streets elements using this framework.

## LOS (Level of Service)

A grading system (A through F) for traffic flow, where A means free-flowing and F means gridlock. Traditionally used to evaluate intersections and roads from a *car driver's* perspective.

**Why it matters:** LOS has historically been used to block dense development or transit projects because they'd "worsen traffic." Urbanists argue that LOS is a car-centric metric that shouldn't drive land use decisions. Washington state passed reforms allowing cities to use alternative metrics.

## Mode Share

The percentage of trips taken by each transportation mode (driving, transit, biking, walking). Seattle's goal is to reduce the car mode share and increase all other modes.

**Why it matters:** Mode share is how we measure whether investments in transit, bike lanes, and walkability are actually changing behavior. Seattle's downtown has seen significant mode shift away from cars, but most neighborhoods are still car-dominant.

## ST3 (Sound Transit 3)

The $54 billion regional transit expansion plan approved by voters in 2016. Includes light rail extensions to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and other areas. Full build-out expected by 2041+.

**Why it matters:** ST3 is the biggest infrastructure investment in the region's history. Delays and cost overruns have been controversial. Understanding the project timeline and station locations is essential for following development patterns.

## TOD (Transit-Oriented Development)

Higher-density, mixed-use development concentrated near transit stations. The idea is that people living/working near good transit will drive less.

**Why it matters:** With Link light rail expanding, TOD around new stations is one of the biggest development opportunities in Seattle's history. Station area planning determines whether these areas become walkable neighborhoods or park-and-ride wastelands.

## Vision Zero

A policy commitment to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Seattle adopted Vision Zero in 2015.

**Why it matters:** Despite the commitment, Seattle's traffic deaths have been *increasing*. Vision Zero gives advocates a framework to demand safer street design, lower speed limits, and enforcement -- the city has committed to this goal and can be held accountable.

## VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)

Total miles driven by vehicles in an area. An alternative to LOS for measuring transportation system performance that doesn't privilege car throughput.

**Why it matters:** Washington now allows cities to use VMT instead of LOS for evaluating development impacts. This is a significant policy shift that can unlock denser development near transit.
