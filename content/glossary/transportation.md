# Transportation Terms

## 15-Minute City

An urban planning concept where residents can reach daily necessities -- work, school, shopping, healthcare, parks -- within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Popularized by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and professor Carlos Moreno.

**Why it matters:** Seattle's Office of Planning and Community Development has explored the 15-minute city as a framework for comprehensive planning. A 2021 study found only 44% of Seattleites can walk to basic amenities, with large gaps in West Seattle, Northeast Seattle, and other car-dependent areas. The concept connects zoning, transit, and land use goals.

## Bicycle Master Plan

Seattle's long-range plan for building a citywide network of bike infrastructure, including protected bike lanes, neighborhood greenways, and trail connections. The plan envisions 100+ miles of protected lanes and 250 miles of greenways.

**Why it matters:** The Bicycle Master Plan sets priorities for which bike routes get built and when. Progress has been slower than planned -- the Move Seattle levy promised 50 miles of protected lanes but delivered far fewer. Understanding the plan helps advocates push for specific route improvements.

---

## Complete Streets

A street design approach that considers all users -- pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and drivers -- not just cars. May include wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, bus-only lanes, and traffic calming.

**Why it matters:** Seattle adopted a Complete Streets policy, and it shapes how SDOT designs road projects. When a street gets rebuilt, advocates can push for complete streets elements using this framework.

## Induced Demand

The phenomenon where adding road capacity generates additional traffic, typically erasing congestion benefits within a few years. Research shows a 10% increase in lane capacity correlates with roughly 9% more traffic.

**Why it matters:** Induced demand is a core urbanist argument against highway expansion. Seattle's $4 billion SR-99 tunnel didn't reduce congestion, and proposals to widen I-5 face criticism on these grounds. Understanding induced demand reframes transportation debates from "how do we reduce congestion" to "how do we reduce driving."

---

## LOS (Level of Service)

A grading system (A through F) for traffic flow, where A means free-flowing and F means gridlock. Traditionally used to evaluate intersections and roads from a *car driver's* perspective.

**Why it matters:** LOS has historically been used to block dense development or transit projects because they'd "worsen traffic." Urbanists argue that LOS is a car-centric metric that shouldn't drive land use decisions. Washington state passed reforms allowing cities to use alternative metrics.

---

## Mode Share

The percentage of trips taken by each transportation mode (driving, transit, biking, walking). Seattle's goal is to reduce the car mode share and increase all other modes.

**Why it matters:** Mode share is how we measure whether investments in transit, bike lanes, and walkability are actually changing behavior. Seattle's downtown has seen significant mode shift away from cars, but most neighborhoods are still car-dominant.

---

## Neighborhood Greenways

A network of residential streets with traffic calming, wayfinding signs, and crossing improvements designed to prioritize walking and biking. Seattle has built about 100 miles of greenways, typically on low-traffic streets parallel to busy arterials.

**Why it matters:** Greenways are a lower-cost way to expand the bike network compared to protected lanes on arterials. They work well for confident cyclists but critics note they require navigating intersections with busy streets. The greenway network connects to the broader Bicycle Master Plan vision.

---

## Protected Bike Lane (PBL)

A bike lane physically separated from car traffic by barriers, planters, parked cars, or grade separation -- not just paint. Also called "cycle tracks" or "separated bike lanes."

**Why it matters:** Protected lanes dramatically increase cycling rates and safety compared to painted lanes. Seattle has been slowly building PBLs on key corridors like 2nd Avenue downtown, Pike/Pine, and MLK Way S. The city's levy proposals have fallen short of promised mileage, making PBL advocacy a persistent focus.

## RapidRide

King County Metro's bus rapid transit (BRT) network featuring frequent service (every 10 minutes or better), branded stations, off-board payment, and transit signal priority. Currently includes lines A through H, with more planned.

**Why it matters:** RapidRide lines trigger additional zoning capacity under HB 1110 -- areas within a quarter-mile of RapidRide stops can allow up to 6 units per lot. The network is also key to Seattle's transit-oriented development strategy. Metro's long-range plan envisions 26 RapidRide lines (A-Z) by 2050.

## ST3 (Sound Transit 3)

The $54 billion regional transit expansion plan approved by voters in 2016. Includes light rail extensions to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and other areas. Full build-out expected by 2041+.

**Why it matters:** ST3 is the biggest infrastructure investment in the region's history. Delays and cost overruns have been controversial. Understanding the project timeline and station locations is essential for following development patterns.

---

## TOD (Transit-Oriented Development)

Higher-density, mixed-use development concentrated near transit stations. The idea is that people living/working near good transit will drive less.

**Why it matters:** With Link light rail expanding, TOD around new stations is one of the biggest development opportunities in Seattle's history. Station area planning determines whether these areas become walkable neighborhoods or park-and-ride wastelands.

---

## Vision Zero

A policy commitment to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Seattle adopted Vision Zero in 2015.

**Why it matters:** Despite the commitment, Seattle's traffic deaths have been *increasing*. Vision Zero gives advocates a framework to demand safer street design, lower speed limits, and enforcement -- the city has committed to this goal and can be held accountable.

---

## VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)

Total miles driven by vehicles in an area. An alternative to LOS for measuring transportation system performance that doesn't privilege car throughput.

**Why it matters:** Washington now allows cities to use VMT instead of LOS for evaluating development impacts. This is a significant policy shift that can unlock denser development near transit.
