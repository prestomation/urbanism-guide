# Seattle Urbanism Timeline

Seattle's urban landscape didn't happen by accident. Decades of decisions -- some visionary, some disastrous -- shaped the city you see today. This timeline highlights the key moments that matter for understanding current debates.

{{< timeline >}}

## How to read this timeline

Each entry includes:
- **What happened** -- The event, policy, or decision
- **Why it mattered** -- How it shaped what came after
- **Legacy** -- How it connects to today's debates

The entries are deliberately selective. This isn't a comprehensive history -- it's the context you need to understand *why things are the way they are*.
