# Welcome to the Seattle Urbanism Guide

If you've ever been to a community meeting about a new bike lane, housing development, or transit project and felt like everyone else in the room had context you didn't -- this guide is for you.

## The gap we're trying to fill

Seattle has great urbanist media. [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/) does excellent journalism. [Seattle Transit Blog](https://seattletransitblog.com/) covers transit in depth. [Seattle Neighborhood Greenways](https://seattlegreenways.org/) does important advocacy work.

But these resources share a common assumption: you already have a baseline understanding of how the city works, what the acronyms mean, and what the history is. If you're new to Seattle or new to caring about urban issues, there's a steep learning curve before you can even follow the conversation.

This guide is that missing baseline. It's a **reference**, not a news source. The goal is to give you enough context that when you read an Urbanist article or attend a Sound Transit open house, you can engage meaningfully.

## What you'll find here

- **[Quick Start](/quick-start/)** -- A plain-language overview of Seattle's urban landscape
- **[Glossary](/glossary/)** -- Definitions of terms you'll encounter in urbanist discussions
- **[Timeline](/timeline/)** -- Key events that shaped Seattle's built environment
- **[Get Involved](/get-involved/)** -- Advocacy organizations you can join to make a difference
- **[Recommended Reading](/recommended-reading/)** -- Publications and writers covering Seattle urbanism
- **[Data](/data/)** -- Dashboards and reports for evidence-based arguments
- **Blog** -- You're reading it. Longer-form pieces on specific topics.
