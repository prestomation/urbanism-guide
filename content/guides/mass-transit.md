# Mass Transit in Seattle

The Seattle region operates one of the most extensive public transit networks on the West Coast, with light rail, buses, commuter rail, streetcars, ferries, and water taxis serving three counties. This guide covers the current system, its history, how it's funded and planned, and where to find data.

## Current system

### Link light rail

**Link light rail** is the backbone of the region's transit system, operated by [Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/). As of early 2026, the system has three lines, 48 stations, and approximately 55 miles of track. Link is the 4th-highest ridership light rail system in the United States. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/13/link-light-rail-smashes-ridership-record-in-october/))

**[1 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/1-line)** (Lynnwood -- Federal Way): The original and busiest line runs 41 miles through 26 stations, connecting Lynnwood City Center in Snohomish County to Federal Way Downtown in south King County. Key stops include Northgate, the University District, Capitol Hill, downtown Seattle (Westlake, Symphony, Pioneer Square), the International District, Beacon Hill, the Rainier Valley, SeaTac Airport, and Federal Way. Service runs approximately every 6 minutes at peak. ([Sound Transit 1 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/1-line))

**[2 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/east-link-extension)** (Downtown Redmond -- Lynnwood via Seattle): The 2 Line currently operates 10 stations on the Eastside from South Bellevue to Downtown Redmond. On **March 28, 2026**, the cross-lake segment opens, extending the 2 Line across the I-90 floating bridge -- the first light rail line on a floating bridge anywhere in the world -- with new stations at Mercer Island and Judkins Park. The 2 Line will then run from Redmond to Lynnwood, sharing tracks with the 1 Line north of International District/Chinatown. Combined headways between Lynnwood and downtown Seattle will be approximately every 4 minutes. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2026/01/23/sound-transits-2-line-will-finally-connect-across-i-90-on-march-28/))

**[T Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/t-line)** (Tacoma): A streetcar-style line connecting downtown Tacoma, the Hilltop neighborhood, and Tacoma Dome Station.

### King County Metro buses

**[King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro)** is the primary bus operator within Seattle and King County, and the 8th-largest transit bus agency in the United States. Metro operates 143 fixed routes using approximately 1,400 vehicles, including diesel-electric hybrids, electric trolleybuses (the 2nd-largest trolleybus system in the U.S.), and a growing battery-electric fleet. Metro carried **88.9 million passengers** in 2024. ([King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/about/data-and-reports))

### RapidRide

**[RapidRide](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/bus/rapidride)** is Metro's bus rapid transit (BRT) network, featuring frequent all-day service (every 6-15 minutes), branded stations, off-board payment, and transit signal priority. Eight lines currently operate:

| Line | Corridor | Opened |
|------|----------|--------|
| A | Federal Way -- Tukwila | 2010 |
| B | Redmond -- Bellevue | 2011 |
| C | Downtown Seattle -- West Seattle | 2012 |
| D | Downtown Seattle -- Ballard/Crown Hill | 2012 |
| E | Downtown Seattle -- Shoreline (Aurora Ave) | 2014 |
| F | Burien -- Renton via Tukwila | 2014 |
| H | Downtown Seattle -- Burien via Delridge | 2023 |
| G | Downtown Seattle -- Madison/MLK Jr. Way | 2024 |

The **RapidRide E Line** on Aurora Avenue is the highest-ridership bus route in the region. The **G Line**, which opened September 2024, is Seattle's first true BRT line with dedicated transit lanes on Madison Street and is the most productive route in the system at 48.4 riders per revenue hour. ([King County Metro Blog](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/09/12/growth-gains-and-greatness-one-year-of-rapidride-g/))

Four more lines are planned: **I Line** (Renton-Kent-Auburn, 2027), **J Line** (downtown Seattle-Eastlake-U District, 2027), **K Line** (Totem Lake-Bellevue-Eastgate, 2030), and **R Line** (downtown Seattle-Rainier Beach, 2031). ([King County Metro RapidRide](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/bus/rapidride))

### Sounder commuter rail

**[Sounder](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/s-line)** is Sound Transit's commuter rail service running on BNSF Railway tracks. The system carried **1.92 million passengers** in 2024.

**S Line** (Seattle -- Lakewood): The workhorse of the system, carrying 99% of all Sounder ridership. Nine stations connect King Street Station in Pioneer Square to Lakewood via Tukwila, Kent, Auburn, Sumner, Puyallup, Tacoma Dome, and South Tacoma. Service runs weekdays during peak commute hours with 13 daily round-trips. Special event service operates for Seahawks, Sounders FC, and Mariners games. ([Sound Transit S Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/s-line))

**N Line** (Seattle -- Everett): Four daily round-trips connecting King Street Station to Everett via Edmonds and Mukilteo. Service doubled in fall 2024 to coincide with the Lynnwood Link light rail opening. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/07/20/doubling-sounder-north-service/))

### Seattle Streetcar

The **[Seattle Streetcar](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/getting-around/transit/streetcar)** consists of two disconnected lines owned by SDOT and operated by King County Metro. Combined ridership reached **1.49 million passengers** in 2024, recovering to 80% of pre-pandemic levels.

**First Hill Line** (opened 2016): 2.5 miles connecting Pioneer Square through the International District, First Hill, and Capitol Hill on Broadway. Carries the bulk of streetcar ridership (1.27 million in 2024) and is the more productive of the two lines at 52 riders per revenue hour. The First Hill line was built as mitigation after Sound Transit decided not to build a light rail station on First Hill. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2026/01/23/seattle-streetcar-faces-uncertain-future-as-newest-line-turns-ten))

**South Lake Union Line** (opened 2007): 1.3 miles connecting Westlake Hub to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center via Westlake Avenue, Seattle's first modern streetcar line. Ridership has declined significantly since its 2013 peak and the line faces a potential **eight-year shutdown** when Ballard Link Extension construction closes a section of Westlake Avenue for station construction at Westlake and Denny Way, expected to begin toward the end of the decade. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2026/01/23/seattle-streetcar-faces-uncertain-future-as-newest-line-turns-ten))

A planned **Center City Connector** (later renamed **Culture Connector**) would have linked the two lines along 1st Avenue through downtown, but the project was halted by Mayor Durkan in 2018 due to cost overruns and is effectively dead as of 2026. ([SDOT Culture Connector](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/transit-program/culture-connector))

### Washington State Ferries

**[Washington State Ferries](https://wsdot.wa.gov/travel/washington-state-ferries)** (WSF) is the largest ferry system in the United States. Two automobile ferry routes serve Seattle from **Colman Dock** on the downtown waterfront:

- **Seattle -- Bainbridge Island** (35 minutes): The busiest route in the system with 5.2 million riders in 2025
- **Seattle -- Bremerton** (60 minutes): Saw 31.9% ridership growth in 2025 after two-boat service was restored

System-wide ridership reached **20.1 million passengers** in 2025, the strongest total since pre-pandemic 2019. WSF is undergoing a **$3.98 billion electrification program** to convert diesel vessels to hybrid-electric power and build 16 new hybrid vessels over 17 years. The ferry Wenatchee returned to service in mid-2025 as North America's largest hybrid-electric passenger vessel. ([WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/about/news/2026/state-ferry-ridership-rises-nearly-1-million-2025-full-domestic-service-returns-cancellations-plunge))

### King County Water Taxi

The **[King County Water Taxi](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/water-taxi/west-seattle)**, operated by King County Metro, serves two routes from Pier 50 in downtown Seattle:

- **West Seattle** (Seacrest Park): 10-15 minute crossing; carried over 178,000 passengers in summer 2025, the busiest summer since 2019
- **Vashon Island**: Launched midday service in July 2024 (the first-ever midday sailings), resulting in a 55% ridership increase; Saturday service pilot began October 2025

([King County Metro Blog](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/10/07/west-seattle-water-taxi-sails-into-fall-after-busy-summer/))

### Seattle Center Monorail

The **[Seattle Center Monorail](https://www.seattlemonorail.com/)** is a 0.9-mile elevated line running along 5th Avenue between Westlake Center in downtown Seattle and Seattle Center (home of the Space Needle and Climate Pledge Arena). Built in just eight months for the **1962 World's Fair**, the monorail is one of Seattle's most iconic transit links and a city-designated historic landmark since 2003. ([Seattle Monorail](https://www.seattlemonorail.com/about-the-monorail/))

The system retains its original two Alweg trains -- the Blue Train and Red Train -- each carrying up to 450 passengers on a 2-minute ride. The monorail carried approximately **2.16 million passengers** in 2024, averaging 5,157 weekday riders and 7,885 weekend riders, boosted by Climate Pledge Arena events where tickets include free transit.

**Operator and funding:** Unlike every other transit service in the region, the monorail operates at a **profit with no taxpayer operating subsidy**. A private contractor, **Seattle Monorail Services**, has operated the system since 1994. Revenue comes entirely from fares and federal capital grants.

**Fares:** $4 adults, $2 youth/seniors/reduced fare. The monorail began accepting **ORCA cards** in 2019 and youth ride free. As of January 2026, ORCA E-purse riders no longer receive free transfers, though PugetPass and Regional Day Pass holders are unaffected. ([Seattle Monorail ORCA Policy](https://www.seattlemonorail.com/2026-orca-transfer-policy/))

**Failed expansion:** In 1997, Seattle voters approved Initiative 41, calling for a citywide monorail network. Voters reaffirmed support in three more elections (2000, 2002, 2004), creating the **Seattle Monorail Project** to build a 14-mile "Green Line" from Ballard to West Seattle. But the project's financing plan revealed that interest charges would push the total cost of the $2.1 billion project to over $11 billion. In November 2005, voters rejected the project by a 64.5-35.5% margin. ([HistoryLink: Initiative 41](https://www.historylink.org/File/2525) | [HistoryLink: 2005 Defeat](https://www.historylink.org/File/7638))

### Regional bus agencies

**Sound Transit Express** (ST Express): Regional express bus service connecting major urban centers across three counties. Major changes are planned for fall 2026, including eliminating Route 550 (Seattle-Bellevue) after the 2 Line replaces it, and adding three new overnight routes. ([Sound Transit 2026 Service Plan](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/planning-future-service/2026-service-plan))

**[Stride](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/stride-bus-rapid-transit)** BRT: Sound Transit's upcoming bus rapid transit network with three lines (S1, S2, S3) using battery-electric buses on I-405 and SR-522 corridors, scheduled to open 2028-2029. ([Sound Transit Stride](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/stride-bus-rapid-transit))

**Community Transit**: Serves Snohomish County with local buses and three **Swift** BRT lines. Restructured its entire network in September 2024 to feed Lynnwood Link light rail stations instead of running express buses to downtown Seattle.

**Pierce Transit**: Serves Tacoma and Pierce County. Launched the **Stream Community Line** in 2024, a limited-stop service between Spanaway and Tacoma Dome Station.

## History

### 1996: Sound Move (ST1) approved

Voters approved the region's first major transit investment package, authorizing **$3.9 billion** for Link light rail from downtown Seattle to SeaTac Airport, Sounder commuter rail, and ST Express bus service. The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (later renamed Sound Transit) had been created by the state legislature in 1993. ([Sound Transit History](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/building-system/history-voter-approved-plans))

### 2000-2003: First rail service

Sounder S Line commuter rail began service in September 2000, connecting Seattle to Tacoma. Tacoma Link (now the T Line) opened in 2003 as Sound Transit's first rail service.

### 2007: South Lake Union Streetcar opens

Seattle's first modern streetcar line began operating in December 2007, running 1.3 miles through the rapidly developing South Lake Union neighborhood.

### 2008: Sound Transit 2 approved

Voters approved **$13.5 billion** in capital projects (ST2) to extend light rail to Lynnwood, Redmond, and Federal Way, expanding the system from 14 to 55 miles. A similar measure had failed in 2007. ([Sound Transit 2](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/sound-transit-2))

### 2009: Link light rail opens

Central Link light rail began revenue service on **July 18, 2009**, running 14 miles from Westlake station in downtown Seattle to Tukwila International Boulevard. SeaTac Airport station opened later that year in December.

### 2016: Landmark year for transit expansion

Three major events in 2016 transformed the system:

- **March**: Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations opened, the first northward expansion of Link
- **September**: Angle Lake station opened, extending the line south
- **November**: Voters approved **Sound Transit 3** (ST3), a **$54 billion** package authorizing 62 more miles of light rail to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma Dome, Everett, and the Eastside, plus Stride BRT and Sounder improvements. It was the largest transit investment in the region's history. ([Sound Transit ST3](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/sound-transit-3))

### 2021: Northgate Link Extension

Three new stations (Northgate, Roosevelt, U District) opened in October 2021, connecting north Seattle and triggering the first of several major bus network restructures feeding light rail.

### 2024: Rapid expansion

- **April**: 2 Line opened its initial Eastside segment from South Bellevue to Redmond Technology, bringing light rail to the Eastside for the first time
- **August**: Lynnwood Link Extension opened with 4 new stations, extending the 1 Line into Snohomish County and triggering bus restructures across Community Transit and King County Metro
- **August**: Sound Transit introduced a **$3 flat fare** on Link, replacing the previous distance-based system. Tap-off was eliminated.
- **September**: RapidRide G Line opened on Madison Street, Seattle's first true BRT with dedicated transit lanes
- **October**: Link set an all-time monthly ridership record of **3.08 million boardings**

([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/13/link-light-rail-smashes-ridership-record-in-october/))

### 2025: Continued growth

- **May**: 2 Line extended to Downtown Redmond with two new stations (Marymoor Village, Downtown Redmond)
- **December**: Federal Way Link Extension opened with 3 new stations (Kent Des Moines, Star Lake, Federal Way Downtown), extending the 1 Line by 7.8 miles

### 2026: Cross-lake connection

On **March 28, 2026**, the 2 Line extends across the I-90 floating bridge to Seattle, adding Mercer Island and Judkins Park stations. The 2 Line will then operate from Downtown Redmond to Lynnwood City Center via downtown Seattle. A **Pinehurst infill station** (NE 130th Street) is also expected to open in 2026. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/crosslake-connection-opens-march-28))

## Future expansion

Sound Transit is building several major extensions under the ST3 program, though timelines and budgets have shifted significantly since the 2016 vote due to inflation, construction cost increases (71.5% since 2020), and pandemic-related revenue shortfalls. A **$20-25 billion affordability gap** was announced in August 2025. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/10/how-ballard-and-west-seattle-light-rail-became-a-30-billion-undertaking/))

| Project | Description | Target Opening |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [West Seattle Link Extension](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/west-seattle-ballard-link-extensions) | 4.1 miles from SODO to Alaska Junction; 4 new stations | ~2032 |
| [Ballard Link Extension](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/ballard-link-extension) | 7.7 miles from downtown Seattle to Ballard; 9 new stations; includes a second downtown transit tunnel | ~2039 |
| Tacoma Dome Link Extension | Extends the 1 Line south from Federal Way to Tacoma Dome | ~2035 |
| Everett Link Extension | 16 miles and 6 stations extending the 1 Line north from Lynnwood to Everett | ~2037-2041 |
| Graham Street infill station | Fills a 1.6-mile gap on the 1 Line between Columbia City and Othello | ~2031 |
| [Stride BRT](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/stride-bus-rapid-transit) | Three BRT lines (S1, S2, S3) on I-405 and SR-522 corridors | 2028-2029 |

At full build-out, the Link system is projected to have approximately 116 miles, 70 stations, and 5 lines serving Everett to Tacoma with branches to Redmond, Ballard, and West Seattle.

## How the region funds and plans transit

### Voter-approved packages

Sound Transit's capital program is funded primarily through three voter-approved tax packages:

- **Sound Move / ST1** (1996): $3.9 billion for initial Link, Sounder, and ST Express
- **Sound Transit 2** (2008): $13.5 billion in capital projects for Link extensions to Lynnwood, Redmond, and Federal Way
- **Sound Transit 3** (2016): $54 billion for Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma Dome, and Everett extensions plus Stride BRT

These packages are funded by a combination of sales tax (currently 1.4% across the Sound Transit district), motor vehicle excise tax, and property tax (up to 25 cents per $1,000 assessed value). Between 1996 and 2023, the three packages generated over **$21.8 billion** in tax revenue. ([Sound Transit Funding](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/paying-regional-transit))

### King County Metro funding

Metro is funded primarily by a **0.9% sales tax** within King County, plus property tax, state and federal grants, and fares (which account for only about 8% of total revenue). Metro's 2026-2027 budget totals **$4 billion** and adds over 400,000 new service hours. Post-pandemic federal relief funds (~$1 billion) have helped maintain financial stability. ([King County Metro Blog](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/24/approved-king-county-metros-2026-27-budget-adds-service-invests-in-zero-emissions-safety-and-cleaning/))

### Seattle Transit Measure

Seattle voters approved the **Seattle Transit Measure** (STM) in 2020, a 6-year measure funded by a 0.15% sales tax generating over $50 million annually. It funds 8% of Metro's bus service in Seattle, streetcar operations, and transportation access programs like **ORCA Opportunity** (free transit passes for qualifying residents). The STM expires in April 2027 and is expected to go before voters for renewal in 2026.

### Federal grants

Federal grants have been critical for major projects. Recent awards include $79.7 million for RapidRide I Line, $64.2 million for RapidRide J Line, and $59.9 million for RapidRide G Line.

### Key planning documents

- **[Seattle Transportation Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/about-us/seattle-transportation-plan)** (adopted 2024): 20-year unified multimodal plan replacing separate walking, biking, transit, and freight plans
- **[Metro Connects](https://kingcounty.gov/en/-/media/king-county/depts/metro/documents/about/policies/2021-11-17-metro-connects.pdf)**: King County Metro's 30-year vision for 70% more service by 2050
- **[Sound Transit System Expansion](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion)**: Capital program delivering voter-approved ST1, ST2, and ST3 projects

## ORCA fare system

**[ORCA](https://info.myorca.com/)** (One Regional Card for All) is the unified fare payment smart card for the Puget Sound region, accepted across 8 transit agencies: King County Metro, Sound Transit, Community Transit, Everett Transit, Pierce Transit, Kitsap Transit, Washington State Ferries, and the Seattle Center Monorail. A next-generation system launched in 2022, and Google Wallet support was added in 2024. Contactless credit/debit card tap-to-pay began trials on RapidRide G in February 2026.

**Current fares (as of September 2025):**

| Service | Adult | ORCA LIFT | Youth (18 & under) |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Metro bus / Link / Streetcar | $3.00 | $1.00 | Free |
| ST Express | $3.00 | $1.00 | Free |
| Sounder | $3.25-$5.75 | $1.00 | Free |
| T Line (Tacoma) | $2.00 | $1.00 | Free |
| Regional Day Pass | $6.00 | $2.00 | Free |

**[ORCA LIFT](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/fares-and-payment/reduced-fares/orca-lift)** provides a $1.00 reduced fare for riders with household income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Free youth transit (18 and under) is statewide, funded through the 2022 Move Ahead Washington package.

## Bus network restructures

As Link light rail expands, King County Metro and other agencies restructure bus networks to feed new stations instead of duplicating rail service. This is one of the most significant ongoing changes to the transit system:

- **Lynnwood Link Connections** (2024-2026): Routes redesigned to feed Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, and Shoreline stations. Community Transit eliminated nearly all downtown Seattle express service.
- **East Link Connections** (2025-2026): 8 new routes, 16 revised routes, and 20 routes deleted/replaced to connect with 2 Line stations. ST Express Route 550 (Seattle-Bellevue) will be eliminated when the full 2 Line opens in March 2026.
- **South Link Connections** (2025-2026): Restructure to serve Federal Way Link stations, including 3 new routes and 13 routes removed.

These restructures create tension between **frequency** (running fewer routes more often) and **coverage** (serving more areas less frequently), a perennial debate in transit planning. ([King County Metro East Link Connections](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/programs-and-projects/east-link-connections))

## Advocacy organizations

- **[Transit Riders Union](https://transitriders.org/):** Independent, member-run union organizing for better public transit. Won the ORCA LIFT low-income fare program and campaigns for service improvements and affordability.
- **[Transportation Choices Coalition](https://transportationchoices.org/):** Statewide policy and advocacy nonprofit that led the coalition winning voter approval for ST3's $54 billion transit investment.
- **[Cascade Bicycle Club](https://cascade.org/):** Advocates for bike infrastructure as first/last-mile connections to transit; member of the MASS Coalition (Move All Seattle Sustainably).
