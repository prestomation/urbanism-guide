# Pedestrian Safety & Infrastructure in Seattle

Walking is the most fundamental form of transportation, and every transit trip begins and ends on foot. Seattle's pedestrian network includes over 2,300 miles of sidewalks, but nearly a quarter of the city's streets still lack them. This guide covers sidewalk infrastructure, crossing improvements, safety programs, and how the city plans and funds pedestrian projects.

## Current state of pedestrian infrastructure

### Sidewalks

Seattle has more than 2,300 miles of sidewalks spanning over 34,000 blocks, but roughly 25% of city streets have no sidewalk at all. Gaps are concentrated in neighborhoods annexed after World War II, particularly in North Seattle, West Seattle, and Southeast Seattle, where residential streets were built to rural standards without curbs or sidewalks. ([SDOT Sidewalk Development Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/sidewalk-development-program))

Traditional concrete sidewalks cost $400,000 or more per block to construct. To close gaps faster, SDOT also builds **neighborhood walkways** — simplified paths using asphalt, gravel, or other materials that can often be installed for under $100,000 per block. The **Seattle Transportation Levy** (2024) commits to building 350 blocks of new sidewalks and walkways over eight years, with 250 in the first four years. ([SDOT Sidewalk Development Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/sidewalk-development-program))

### Crossings

SDOT's **Crossing Improvement Program** evaluates and upgrades intersections to make them safer for people on foot. Treatments include marked crosswalks, pedestrian refuge islands, rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFBs), concrete curb bulbs that shorten crossing distances, and **leading pedestrian intervals** (LPIs) that give walkers a head start before drivers get a green light. ([SDOT Crossing Improvement Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/crossing-improvement-program))

As of 2024, SDOT had installed LPIs at over 700 of the city's roughly 1,000 traffic signals — nearly three-quarters of locations where they are feasible. At locations with LPIs installed between 2009 and 2018, SDOT measured a 48% reduction in pedestrian turning collisions and a 34% reduction in serious injury and fatal pedestrian collisions. ([SDOT Leading Pedestrian Intervals](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero/leading-pedestrian-intervals) | [SDOT Blog](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2018/12/06/leading-pedestrian-intervals-every-second-counts/))

### Curb ramps and accessibility

In 2017, the city settled the *Reynoldson v. City of Seattle* lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Washington on behalf of people with mobility disabilities. Under the consent decree, Seattle committed to building or upgrading 22,500 curb ramps over 18 years — approximately 1,250 per year — at an estimated cost of nearly $300 million. ([Disability Rights Washington](https://disabilityrightswa.org/cases/reynoldson-v-city-of-seattle/) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2017/07/24/disability-rights-victory-means-curb-cut-deluge-coming/))

SDOT's **ADA Program** manages curb ramp requests and coordinates with the consent decree requirements. Residents can request curb ramp improvements through the city's "Find It, Fix It" app or by calling 206-684-ROAD. ([SDOT ADA Requests](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/permits-and-services/make-an-ada-request))

### Sidewalk repair

Property owners in Seattle are responsible for maintaining sidewalks adjacent to their property under Seattle Municipal Code Title 15. However, when damage is caused by city-owned trees or infrastructure, SDOT's **Sidewalk Safety Repair Program** handles repairs. SDOT uses a condition rating system (excellent, good, fair, poor, very poor) to prioritize work. The 2026 levy delivery plan includes 34,000 spot repairs to sidewalks. ([SDOT Sidewalk Repair Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/maintenance-and-paving/sidewalk-repair-program) | [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/cracks-gaps-and-uplifts-when-and-how-do-seattles-dangerous-sidewalks-get-fixed/))

## History

### 2015: Vision Zero adopted

Seattle adopted **Vision Zero** in 2015, committing to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The program uses a Safe System Approach that layers engineering, enforcement, education, and policy changes to prevent fatal and serious crashes. Pedestrian safety became a central focus, as people walking are disproportionately represented in traffic fatalities despite making up a fraction of road users. ([SDOT Vision Zero](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero))

### 2015: Levy to Move Seattle funds pedestrian infrastructure

Voters approved the 9-year, $930 million **Levy to Move Seattle**, which included approximately $91 million for pedestrian master plan implementation: $61 million for new sidewalks, $30 million for curb ramps, $15 million for sidewalk repair, and $7 million for Safe Routes to School. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2018/02/08/sdot-unveils-first-five-year-pedestrian-implementation-plan/))

### 2016: Citywide speed limit reduction

In November 2016, Seattle reduced default speed limits citywide: arterial streets dropped from 30 mph to 25 mph, and residential streets from 25 mph to 20 mph. An Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study found the changes led to a 20% reduction in injury crash odds on downtown arterials and an 11% reduction outside the city center. A separate comprehensive study found pedestrian-involved crashes decreased 26% after implementation. ([SDOT Speed Limits](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero/speedlimits) | [IIHS](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/lowering-speed-limits-makes-seattle-streets-safer))

### 2017: Pedestrian Master Plan adopted

Seattle adopted the **Pedestrian Master Plan** (PMP), a 20-year blueprint to make Seattle "the most walkable and accessible city in the nation." The plan established a prioritization framework for sidewalk construction, crossing improvements, and accessibility upgrades, with performance metrics to track progress. ([SDOT Pedestrian Master Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/document-library/citywide-plans/modal-plans/pedestrian-master-plan))

### 2017: Curb ramp consent decree

The *Reynoldson v. City of Seattle* settlement required SDOT to build 1,250 curb ramps annually for 18 years, dramatically accelerating the city's historic pace. ([Disability Rights Washington](https://disabilityrightswa.org/cases/reynoldson-v-city-of-seattle/))

### 2018: First pedestrian implementation plan

SDOT released the first five-year **Pedestrian Master Plan Implementation Plan** (2018–2022), identifying specific sidewalk construction projects, crossing improvements, and program initiatives. The plan included lists of planned projects by neighborhood and served as an accountability tool. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2018/02/08/sdot-unveils-first-five-year-pedestrian-implementation-plan/) | [SDOT Blog](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2019/12/12/pedestrian-master-plan-implementation-improving-walkability-one-step-at-a-time/))

### 2019: Updated implementation plan

SDOT released the 2020–2024 implementation plan, which included 163 blocks of new sidewalks and cost-effective walkways and 147 intersections to evaluate for crossing improvements. ([SDOT Blog](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2019/12/12/pedestrian-master-plan-implementation-improving-walkability-one-step-at-a-time/))

### 2024: Seattle Transportation Plan replaces modal plans

The city adopted the **Seattle Transportation Plan** (STP), a 20-year multimodal plan that replaced the standalone Pedestrian Master Plan along with the bicycle, transit, and freight master plans. The STP includes a Pedestrian Element that prioritizes missing sidewalk segments based on proximity to frequent transit, schools, safety data, and equity. ([SDOT Pedestrian Master Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/document-library/citywide-plans/modal-plans/pedestrian-master-plan))

### 2024: New transportation levy

Voters approved the 8-year, $1.55 billion **Seattle Transportation Levy**, which includes significant pedestrian investments: 350 blocks of new sidewalks and walkways, approximately $70 million for Vision Zero safety projects, continued curb ramp construction, and Safe Routes to School improvements at every public school. ([SDOT Safe Routes to School Milestone](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2024/10/25/safe-routes-to-school-milestone/))

### 2024: Pedestrian fatalities decline

Preliminary data showed 10–11 pedestrian fatalities in Seattle in 2024, roughly half of the modern high of 20 recorded in 2021. It was also the first year with zero bicycling fatalities. However, overall traffic fatalities remained high at 29–32, driven by increases in motor vehicle and motorcycle deaths. ([Seattle Bike Blog](https://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2025/03/06/early-data-shows-seattle-halved-pedestrian-deaths-and-had-zero-bicycling-deaths-in-2024/) | [Cascade PBS](https://www.cascadepbs.org/news/2024/04/seattle-walkable-city-pedestrian-death-rates-show-otherwise))

## How the city plans and funds pedestrian infrastructure

### Planning framework

The **Seattle Transportation Plan** (adopted 2024) is the current guiding document for pedestrian infrastructure, replacing the 2017 Pedestrian Master Plan. The plan's Pedestrian Element prioritizes sidewalk construction and crossing improvements based on safety, equity, and connectivity to transit and schools. ([SDOT Pedestrian Master Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/document-library/citywide-plans/modal-plans/pedestrian-master-plan))

The **Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board** (SPAB), established in 1993 and made permanent by City Council resolution in 1997, advises the Mayor, City Council, and city departments on pedestrian policy. The 11-member board tracks implementation of pedestrian plans and prepares an annual report. ([Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board](https://www.seattle.gov/seattle-pedestrian-advisory-board))

### Funding

Pedestrian infrastructure is funded primarily through voter-approved transportation levies:

- **Levy to Move Seattle** (2015–2024): $930 million total; approximately $91 million for pedestrian projects including new sidewalks, curb ramps, sidewalk repair, and Safe Routes to School
- **Seattle Transportation Levy** (2024–2032): $1.55 billion total; includes 350 blocks of new sidewalks, approximately $70 million for Vision Zero, and continued Safe Routes to School funding

Additional funding comes from federal grants, the Neighborhood Street Fund, and the ADA curb ramp program. The **Transportation Funding Task Force** (created by Resolution 32145 in 2024) is developing long-term policy and funding recommendations for sidewalk construction and maintenance.

### Project prioritization

SDOT prioritizes pedestrian projects based on:

1. **Safety:** Crash history, proximity to high-injury corridors, and Vision Zero data
2. **Equity:** Serving historically underserved neighborhoods and communities with limited mobility options
3. **Connectivity:** Closing gaps near frequent transit stops, schools, parks, libraries, and healthcare facilities
4. **Cost-effectiveness:** Using neighborhood walkways where appropriate to stretch funding further

### Key programs

- **[Safe Routes to School](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/safe-routes-to-school):** Since 2015, SDOT has built over 260 school-focused safety projects and achieved the levy commitment of improvements at every public school. The program distributes walking and biking packages, offers mini-grants for schools, and publishes school walking maps.
- **[Vision Zero](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero):** The city's traffic safety initiative targets high-crash corridors with engineering redesigns including lane reductions, speed cushions, improved lighting, and signal changes.
- **[Aurora Ave N Safety Corridor](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/current-projects/aurora-ave-project):** Aurora Avenue accounts for roughly 20% of Seattle's traffic fatalities. SDOT has installed LPIs at all signalized intersections, added no-turn-on-red restrictions, and is planning a long-term corridor redesign with new sidewalks, pedestrian lighting, and median islands.

## Advocacy organizations

- **[Feet First](https://feetfirst.org/):** Washington state's only dedicated pedestrian advocacy organization, founded in 2001. Promotes walkable communities, supports Safe Routes to School programs, runs walking audits, and led the effort to establish the state Pedestrian Safety Advisory Council in 2015.
- **[Seattle Neighborhood Greenways](https://www.seattlegreenways.org/):** Grassroots organization with 15 neighborhood chapters advocating for safer streets for walking, rolling, and biking. Led the Stay Healthy Streets campaign and advocates for Vision Zero implementation.
- **[Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board](https://www.seattle.gov/seattle-pedestrian-advisory-board):** City advisory board of 11 members that advises the Mayor and City Council on pedestrian policy, tracks plan implementation, and meets monthly at City Hall.
- **[Disability Rights Washington](https://disabilityrightswa.org/):** Led the *Reynoldson v. City of Seattle* lawsuit that secured the curb ramp consent decree. Continues to advocate for ADA-compliant pedestrian infrastructure.
