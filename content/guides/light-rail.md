# Link Light Rail in Seattle

**Link light rail** is the backbone of the Puget Sound region's transit system, operated by [Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/). As of early 2026, the system has three lines, 48 stations, and approximately 55 miles of track. Link is the 4th-highest ridership light rail system in the United States. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/13/link-light-rail-smashes-ridership-record-in-october/))

## Current system

### 1 Line (Lynnwood -- Federal Way)

The **[1 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/1-line)** is the original and busiest line. It runs 41 miles through 26 stations, connecting Lynnwood City Center in Snohomish County to Federal Way Downtown in south King County. Key stops include Northgate, the University District, Capitol Hill, downtown Seattle (Westlake, Symphony, Pioneer Square), the International District, Beacon Hill, the Rainier Valley, SeaTac Airport, and Federal Way. Service runs approximately every 6 minutes at peak. ([Sound Transit 1 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/1-line))

### 2 Line (Downtown Redmond -- Lynnwood via Seattle)

The **[2 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/east-link-extension)** currently operates 10 stations on the Eastside from South Bellevue to Downtown Redmond. On **March 28, 2026**, the cross-lake segment opens, extending the 2 Line across the I-90 floating bridge -- the first light rail line on a floating bridge anywhere in the world -- with new stations at Mercer Island and Judkins Park. The 2 Line will then run from Redmond to Lynnwood, sharing tracks with the 1 Line north of International District/Chinatown. Combined headways between Lynnwood and downtown Seattle will be approximately every 4 minutes. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2026/01/23/sound-transits-2-line-will-finally-connect-across-i-90-on-march-28/))

### T Line (Tacoma)

The **[T Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/t-line)** is a streetcar-style line connecting downtown Tacoma, the Hilltop neighborhood, and Tacoma Dome Station.

## Infrastructure

Link light rail uses a mix of tunnels, elevated guideways, at-grade surface segments, and a floating bridge crossing. Understanding the physical infrastructure helps explain the system's operating characteristics, speed variations, and expansion challenges.

### Tunnels

Link has four major tunneled segments totaling roughly 14 miles of twin-bore tunnel.

**Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT).** The 1.3-mile [Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/underground-seattle-transit-goes-rail-only-march-23) runs west under Pine Street and south under 3rd Avenue, serving four underground stations: Westlake, Symphony (formerly University Street), Pioneer Square, and International District/Chinatown. Originally built in 1987-1990 as a bus tunnel by King County Metro, it was [retrofitted for joint bus-and-rail operations](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/underground-seattle-transit-goes-rail-only-march-23) in 2005-2007 at a cost of approximately $94 million. Buses and trains shared the tunnel from 2009 to 2019, when it became rail-only. The DSTT has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour per direction with 90-second headways.

**Beacon Hill Tunnel.** A roughly one-mile twin-bore tunnel passes under [Beacon Hill](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/tunnel-boring-machine-completes-second-beacon-hill-light) between SODO and the Rainier Valley. The tunnel was bored by a 360-ton Mitsubishi tunnel boring machine nicknamed the "Emerald Mole," featuring a 21-foot-diameter cutterhead. Launched in January 2006, it completed the first 4,300-foot tube in May 2007 and the second in March 2008, emerging within 5 millimeters of its target. Beacon Hill station sits 160 feet underground, making it the system's deepest station, accessed by four high-speed elevators from two shafts excavated to 185 feet. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/tunnel-boring-machine-completes-second-beacon-hill-light))

**University Link Tunnel.** The [3.15-mile tunnel](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/9-quick-facts-about-how-u-link-was-built) connects the DSTT to the University of Washington via Capitol Hill station. Three tunnel boring machines excavated 21-foot-wide tunnels from 2009 to 2012: two Herrenknecht machines named Balto and Togo (launched from UW station southward) and a Hitachi Zosen machine named Brenda (launched from Capitol Hill toward downtown). The tunnel reaches 300 feet below the surface under Volunteer Park and passes just 15 feet beneath Interstate 5 and the Montlake Cut. The extension opened in March 2016, six months early and $200 million under its $1.9 billion budget. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/9-quick-facts-about-how-u-link-was-built))

**Northgate Link Tunnel.** The [3.5-mile twin-bore tunnel](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/8-facts-about-northgate-link-tunneling-project) extends from the University of Washington to Northgate, passing beneath the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Two 600-ton tunnel boring machines with 21.5-foot cutterheads bored the tunnels from 2014 to 2016, mining 20-40 feet per day at depths of 60 to 140 feet. The tunnel serves Roosevelt and U District stations. The extension opened in October 2021 and cost $1.9 billion. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/8-facts-about-northgate-link-tunneling-project))

A [second downtown transit tunnel](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/digging-details-new-downtown-seattle-light-rail-tunnel) is planned as part of the Ballard Link Extension (ST3), with six new underground stations. This tunnel is needed because the existing DSTT will reach capacity with two lines operating at peak frequency.

### Bridges and elevated segments

**I-90 Floating Bridge crossing.** The 2 Line crosses Lake Washington on the [Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/crossing-lake-washington), a 1.1-mile floating span built in 1989 with provisions for future light rail in its center express lanes. This is the first light rail line on a floating bridge anywhere in the world. Engineers designed a [specialized "track bridge"](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/bridging-gap-making-tracks-to-connect-eastside-with-link-light-rail) system to accommodate six degrees of motion from changing lake levels, wind, waves, and traffic loading. Rails rest on approximately 9,000 lightweight concrete blocks attached to the bridge deck with a shock-absorbing material called corkelast, held in place by polymers that require no drilling into the deck. The blocks and polymers were tested at the University of Washington, and the track bridge prototypes were validated at the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado at speeds up to 55 mph. *Popular Science* named the floating bridge rail technology [one of the most important engineering innovations of 2017](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/crossing-lake-washington). A cathodic protection system prevents stray electrical current from corroding the bridge's steel anchor cables. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/bridging-gap-making-tracks-to-connect-eastside-with-link-light-rail))

**I-405 bridge.** An 810-foot bridge carries the 2 Line across Interstate 405 in Bellevue, connecting the Bellevue Downtown and Wilburton stations.

**Elevated guideways.** Significant elevated segments include the guideway through SODO and Tukwila, the approach to SeaTac Airport, the Lynnwood and Federal Way extensions, and the Eastside guideway through South Bellevue. The elevated alignment north of Northgate carries the 1 Line to Lynnwood City Center.

### At-grade segments

The 1 Line runs [at-grade for 4.5 miles](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/02/sound-transit-rainier-valley-safety-plan/) in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South through the Rainier Valley, serving Columbia City, Othello, and Rainier Beach stations. This segment has 28 signalized crossings with partial gates where trains share the right-of-way with vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. The at-grade alignment was a cost-saving decision in the original Sound Move plan; other parts of the system are tunneled or elevated. Since 2009, this stretch has been the site of [136 collisions](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/02/sound-transit-rainier-valley-safety-plan/) between trains and vehicles, people, or objects. Sound Transit is spending $14-21 million to add pedestrian gates at Columbia City and Othello stations by mid-2026. Sound Transit has stated that all future Link extensions will be grade-separated (elevated or tunneled). ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/02/sound-transit-rainier-valley-safety-plan/))

### Light rail vehicles

Sound Transit operates two generations of light rail vehicles on the 1 and 2 Lines, plus a smaller fleet on the T Line.

**Series 1 (Kinkisharyo).** The original fleet of [62 low-floor vehicles](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/first-new-link-light-rail-vehicles-enter-passenger-service), manufactured by Kinkisharyo in Japan and assembled in Everett, Washington. Each car is 95 feet long, 70% low-floor, with 74 seats and a crush-load capacity of 252 passengers. Delivered in three orders from 2006 to 2011 at approximately $4.2 million per unit.

**Series 2 (Siemens S700).** Sound Transit awarded Siemens Mobility a [$554 million contract](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/new-link-light-rail-trains-rolling-service) in 2016 for 122 S700 low-floor vehicles, later expanded to 162. Each car is approximately 95 feet long with 74 seats (70 in some configurations), larger windows, a wider center aisle, four bicycle hooks (twice the Series 1), dynamic passenger information displays, and LED lighting. Assembled at Siemens' plant in Sacramento, California, the first entered service in May 2021. The Series 2 vehicles are not compatible for coupled operations with Series 1 cars; trains are composed entirely of one type or the other. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/new-link-light-rail-trains-rolling-service))

**Series 3 (future).** Sound Transit plans to procure approximately 236 additional vehicles through a competitive bid process to support ST3 extensions. The first Series 3 vehicles are expected to enter service around 2032.

**Operating characteristics.** Trains run at up to 55 mph in tunnels and on elevated segments and 35 mph on surface sections. Revenue service uses two-car, three-car, or four-car consists depending on demand. The system runs on 750V DC overhead catenary power. As of early 2026, the total fleet across all lines is approximately 226 vehicles.

### Operations and maintenance facilities

Sound Transit maintains its fleet at **Operations and Maintenance Facilities (OMFs)** — large rail yards where trains are stored, cleaned, inspected, and repaired.

| Facility | Location | Size | Vehicle capacity | Status |
|----------|----------|------|-----------------|--------|
| **OMF Central** | S. Forest Street, SODO (Seattle) | 25 acres | 104 vehicles | Operating (original facility) |
| **[OMF East](https://dbia.org/project/sound-transit-operations-and-maintenance-facility-east/)** | Spring District, Bellevue | 28 acres (6.9 reserved for TOD) | 96 vehicles | Operating (opened 2024, $236M, LEED Gold) |
| **[OMF South](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/operations-maintenance-facility-south)** | S. 336th Street, Federal Way | ~66-70 acres | 144 vehicles | Design phase (target opening ~2031) |
| **OMF North** | Location TBD (north of Seattle) | TBD | TBD | Early planning |

OMF Central in SODO has served the fleet since the system opened in 2009. OMF East in Bellevue's Spring District opened in 2024 to support 2 Line operations and includes a [transit-oriented development](https://dbia.org/project/sound-transit-operations-and-maintenance-facility-east/) component with planned housing, retail, and office space on 6.9 acres. OMF South in Federal Way will include a 1.4-mile connecting track from the mainline and a 24-hour vehicle testing track; it is expected to create over 610 jobs with an average wage of $45/hour. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/operations-maintenance-facility-south))

## Regional transit timeline

This timeline tracks the openings and notable expansions of all major transit modes in the Seattle region.

### 1962: Seattle Center Monorail opens

The **Seattle Center Monorail** opened for the 1962 World's Fair, running 0.9 miles between Westlake Center and Seattle Center along 5th Avenue. Built in eight months, it was intended as the start of a citywide system. The monorail is now a city-designated historic landmark (since 2003) and carried approximately 2.16 million passengers in 2024. ([Seattle Monorail](https://www.seattlemonorail.com/about-the-monorail/))

### 1996: Sound Move (ST1) approved

Voters approved the region's first major transit investment package, authorizing **$3.9 billion** for Link light rail from downtown Seattle to SeaTac Airport, Sounder commuter rail, and ST Express bus service. The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (later renamed Sound Transit) had been created by the state legislature in 1993. ([Sound Transit History](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/building-system/history-voter-approved-plans))

### 1999: ST Express bus service launches

On September 19, 1999, Sound Transit launched its first service: nine **ST Express** regional bus routes with 114 buses serving three counties. The 550 (Seattle--Bellevue) and 590/595 (Seattle--Tacoma) routes, transferred from local agencies, were already operating. ST Express carried approximately 4.1 million riders in its first full year. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/nine-new-ways-to-get-around-puget-sound-sound-transit-to))

### 2000: Sounder S Line begins service

**Sounder commuter rail** launched in September 2000, connecting Seattle's King Street Station to Tacoma on BNSF Railway tracks. The S Line would grow to become the workhorse of the system, carrying 99% of all Sounder ridership by 2024 with nine stations and 13 daily weekday round-trips. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/celebrating-25-years-sounder-with-25-fun-facts))

### 2003: Tacoma Link and Sounder N Line open

**Tacoma Link** (now the T Line) opened in 2003 as Sound Transit's first rail service, running a free streetcar-style line in downtown Tacoma. The **Sounder N Line** launched on December 22, connecting Seattle to Everett via Edmonds and Mukilteo. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/celebrating-25-years-sounder-with-25-fun-facts))

### 2007: South Lake Union Streetcar opens

Seattle's first modern streetcar line began operating in December 2007, running 1.3 miles through the rapidly developing South Lake Union neighborhood. It was Seattle's first streetcar service since 1941. ([HistoryLink](https://www.historylink.org/File/8421))

### 2008: Sound Transit 2 approved

Voters approved **$13.5 billion** in capital projects (ST2) to extend light rail to Lynnwood, Redmond, and Federal Way, expanding the system from 14 to 55 miles. A similar measure had failed in 2007. ([Sound Transit 2](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/sound-transit-2))

### 2009: Link light rail opens

Central Link light rail began revenue service on **July 18, 2009**, running 14 miles from Westlake station in downtown Seattle to Tukwila International Boulevard. SeaTac Airport station opened later that year in December. In the same year, the regional **ORCA** (One Regional Card for All) fare payment system launched, unifying fare collection across seven transit agencies. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/journey-begins-link-light-rail-opens-service-saturday))

### 2009-2014: Bus rapid transit launches

Washington state's first BRT line, Community Transit's **Swift Blue Line**, opened in November 2009 along SR-99 between Everett and Aurora Village. King County Metro followed with its **RapidRide** network:

| Line | Corridor | Opened |
|------|----------|--------|
| A | Federal Way -- Tukwila | 2010 |
| B | Redmond -- Bellevue | 2011 |
| C | Downtown Seattle -- West Seattle | 2012 |
| D | Downtown Seattle -- Ballard/Crown Hill | 2012 |
| E | Downtown Seattle -- Shoreline (Aurora Ave) | 2014 |
| F | Burien -- Renton via Tukwila | 2014 |

The **RapidRide E Line** on Aurora Avenue became the highest-ridership bus route in the region. ([King County Metro RapidRide](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/bus/rapidride))

### 2016: Landmark year for transit expansion

Four major transit events in 2016:

- **January**: The **First Hill Streetcar** opened, Seattle's second modern streetcar line connecting Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the International District. The 2.5-mile line was built as mitigation after Sound Transit eliminated a planned First Hill light rail station. ([HistoryLink](https://www.historylink.org/File/20867))
- **March**: Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations opened, the first northward expansion of Link
- **September**: Angle Lake station opened, extending the 1 Line south
- **November**: Voters approved **Sound Transit 3** (ST3), a **$54 billion** package authorizing 62 more miles of light rail to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma Dome, Everett, and the Eastside, plus Stride BRT and Sounder improvements. It was the largest transit investment in the region's history. ([Sound Transit ST3](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/sound-transit-3))

### 2017-2019: Kitsap Fast Ferries and Swift Green Line

**Kitsap Fast Ferries** launched high-speed passenger-only catamaran service from the Kitsap Peninsula to downtown Seattle, providing crossings at roughly twice the speed of Washington State Ferries car ferries:

| Route | Crossing Time | Launched |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Bremerton -- Seattle | 30 minutes | 2017 |
| Kingston -- Seattle | 40 minutes | 2018 |

Community Transit opened the **Swift Green Line** in March 2019, its second BRT line connecting Seaway Transit Center to Canyon Park along SR-527. ([Kitsap Daily News](https://www.kitsapdailynews.com/news/kt-ferries-carry-record-1-22-million-riders-in-24/))

### 2021: Northgate Link Extension

Three new Link stations (Northgate, Roosevelt, U District) opened in October 2021, connecting north Seattle and triggering the first of several major bus network restructures feeding light rail. Kitsap Fast Ferries also added a **Southworth -- Seattle** route (26 minutes) in 2021.

### 2022-2023: System modernization

- **May 2022**: The next-generation **ORCA** fare system launched, replacing 2009-era infrastructure with real-time account management, a mobile app, and new card readers. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2022/05/03/new-orca-card-system-launches-may-16-with-weekend-fare-holiday-for-transit-riders/))
- **2023**: **RapidRide H Line** (Downtown Seattle -- Burien via Delridge) opened, the seventh RapidRide line
- **October 2023**: **Colman Dock** renovation completed after a $489 million multi-phase rebuild of the downtown Seattle ferry terminal, Seattle's busiest transit hub for Washington State Ferries. ([WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/search-projects/ferries-seattle-multimodal-terminal-colman-dock-project))

### 2024: Rapid expansion across modes

The biggest year for regional transit openings since 2016:

- **March**: Community Transit's **Swift Orange Line** opened, its third BRT line connecting Edmonds College, Alderwood Mall, and Lynnwood Link light rail
- **April**: The **2 Line** opened its initial Eastside segment from South Bellevue to Redmond Technology, bringing light rail to the Eastside for the first time
- **April**: Pierce Transit launched the **Stream Community Line**, a limited-stop BRT-like service between Tacoma Dome Station and Spanaway. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/03/04/pierce-transit-prepares-to-launch-stream-community-line-express-service/))
- **August**: **Lynnwood Link Extension** opened with 4 new stations, extending the 1 Line into Snohomish County. Community Transit restructured its entire bus network to feed light rail instead of running express buses to downtown Seattle.
- **August**: Sound Transit introduced a **$3 flat fare** on Link, replacing the previous distance-based system. Tap-off was eliminated.
- **September**: **RapidRide G Line** opened on Madison Street, Seattle's first true BRT with dedicated transit lanes and the most productive route in the system at 48.4 riders per revenue hour. ([King County Metro Blog](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/09/12/growth-gains-and-greatness-one-year-of-rapidride-g/))
- **Fall**: Sounder **N Line doubled service** to four daily round-trips to coincide with Lynnwood Link. Amtrak Cascades expanded to **six daily Seattle--Portland round-trips**. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/07/20/doubling-sounder-north-service/))
- **October**: Link set an all-time monthly ridership record of **3.08 million boardings**. Kitsap Fast Ferries reached a system record of **854,529 passengers** for the year. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/13/link-light-rail-smashes-ridership-record-in-october/))

### 2025: Continued growth

- **May**: 2 Line extended to **Downtown Redmond** with two new stations (Marymoor Village, Downtown Redmond)
- **December**: **Federal Way Link Extension** opened with 3 new stations (Kent Des Moines, Star Lake, Federal Way Downtown), extending the 1 Line by 7.8 miles
- Washington State Ferries reached **20.1 million passengers**, the strongest total since pre-pandemic 2019. The ferry Wenatchee returned to service as North America's largest hybrid-electric passenger vessel. ([WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/about/news/2026/state-ferry-ridership-rises-nearly-1-million-2025-full-domestic-service-returns-cancellations-plunge))

### 2026: Cross-lake connection

On **March 28, 2026**, the 2 Line extends across the I-90 floating bridge to Seattle, adding Mercer Island and Judkins Park stations. The 2 Line will then operate from Downtown Redmond to Lynnwood City Center via downtown Seattle. A **Pinehurst infill station** (NE 130th Street) is also expected to open in 2026. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/crosslake-connection-opens-march-28))

## Future expansion

Sound Transit is building several major extensions under the ST3 program, though timelines and budgets have shifted significantly since the 2016 vote due to inflation, construction cost increases (71.5% since 2020), and pandemic-related revenue shortfalls. A **$20-25 billion affordability gap** was announced in August 2025. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/10/how-ballard-and-west-seattle-light-rail-became-a-30-billion-undertaking/))

| Project | Description | Target Opening |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [West Seattle Link Extension](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/west-seattle-ballard-link-extensions) | 4.1 miles from SODO to Alaska Junction; 4 new stations | ~2032 |
| [Ballard Link Extension](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/ballard-link-extension) | 7.7 miles from downtown Seattle to Ballard; 9 new stations; includes a second downtown transit tunnel | ~2039 |
| Tacoma Dome Link Extension | Extends the 1 Line south from Federal Way to Tacoma Dome | ~2035 |
| Everett Link Extension | 16 miles and 6 stations extending the 1 Line north from Lynnwood to Everett | ~2037-2041 |
| Graham Street infill station | Fills a 1.6-mile gap on the 1 Line between Columbia City and Othello | ~2031 |
| [Stride BRT](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/stride-bus-rapid-transit) | Three BRT lines (S1, S2, S3) on I-405 and SR-522 corridors | 2028-2029 |

At full build-out, the Link system is projected to have approximately 116 miles, 70 stations, and 5 lines serving Everett to Tacoma with branches to Redmond, Ballard, and West Seattle.

Four additional **RapidRide** lines are planned: **I Line** (Renton-Kent-Auburn, 2027), **J Line** (downtown Seattle-Eastlake-U District, 2027), **K Line** (Totem Lake-Bellevue-Eastgate, 2030), and **R Line** (downtown Seattle-Rainier Beach, 2031). ([King County Metro RapidRide](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/bus/rapidride))

## How Sound Transit funds expansion

Sound Transit's capital program is funded primarily through three voter-approved tax packages:

- **Sound Move / ST1** (1996): $3.9 billion for initial Link, Sounder, and ST Express
- **Sound Transit 2** (2008): $13.5 billion in capital projects for Link extensions to Lynnwood, Redmond, and Federal Way
- **Sound Transit 3** (2016): $54 billion for Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma Dome, and Everett extensions plus Stride BRT

These packages are funded by a combination of sales tax (currently 1.4% across the Sound Transit district), motor vehicle excise tax, and property tax (up to 25 cents per $1,000 assessed value). Between 1996 and 2023, the three packages generated over **$21.8 billion** in tax revenue. ([Sound Transit Funding](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/paying-regional-transit))
