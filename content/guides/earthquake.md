# Earthquake Preparedness & Seismic Risk in Seattle

Seattle faces the second-highest earthquake risk of any major U.S. metropolitan area, behind only Los Angeles. The city sits near three distinct seismic sources capable of producing damaging earthquakes, and approximately 15% of its land area is built on soil prone to ground failure during shaking. ([Seattle OEM](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/earthquake)) This guide covers the seismic hazards, the city's vulnerable building stock, preparedness programs, and what urbanists and advocates should know.

## Seismic hazard sources

Seattle's earthquake risk comes from three distinct geologic sources, each producing different types of earthquakes at different frequencies and intensities.

### Cascadia Subduction Zone

The **Cascadia Subduction Zone** (CSZ) is an approximately 1,100-kilometer fault running offshore from northern California to Vancouver Island, where the Juan de Fuca plate dives beneath the North American plate. It is capable of producing magnitude 9.0+ megathrust earthquakes. The last full-rupture event occurred on January 26, 1700, generating a tsunami recorded in Japan. USGS estimates a 10-15% probability of a magnitude 9 CSZ earthquake in the next 50 years. ([USGS Earthquake Probabilities](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253050/full) | [DNR Earthquakes and Faults](https://dnr.wa.gov/washington-geological-survey/geologic-hazards-and-environment/earthquakes-and-faults))

### Seattle Fault Zone

The **Seattle Fault Zone** is an east-west trending zone of shallow thrust faults running directly beneath the city, from Bainbridge Island through the area near I-90. It is capable of producing magnitude 7.0-7.5 earthquakes at shallow depths (less than 25 km). The most recent large event occurred around 900-930 CE, generating approximately 3 meters of uplift and a tsunami on Elliott Bay. A 2026 USGS study found that secondary faults within the zone rupture approximately every 350 years, more frequently than previously understood. USGS estimates a 17% probability of a magnitude 6.5+ crustal fault earthquake in the Puget Sound region in the next 50 years. ([USGS Earthquake Probabilities](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253050/full))

### Deep intraplate earthquakes

Deep earthquakes occur within the subducting Juan de Fuca plate at depths of 40-70 km. These were responsible for Seattle's three most damaging modern earthquakes (1949, 1965, and 2001). Deep earthquakes of magnitude 6.0+ occur on average every 30 years in the Puget Sound region, with an estimated 84-85% probability of one in the next 50 years. ([USGS Pacific Northwest Hazards](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/pacific-northwest-hazards))

## Historical earthquakes

### 1949 Olympia earthquake (magnitude 6.7-7.1)

On April 13, 1949, a deep intraplate earthquake struck with its epicenter near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Eight people were killed and property damage reached an estimated $25 million (approximately $265 million in today's dollars). Nearly every building in Pioneer Square was damaged, with effects ranging from lost parapets to entire floors requiring demolition. ([DNR Earthquakes and Faults](https://dnr.wa.gov/washington-geological-survey/geologic-hazards-and-environment/earthquakes-and-faults))

### 1965 Puget Sound earthquake (magnitude 6.7)

On April 29, 1965, another deep intraplate earthquake struck the same region at 59 km depth. Three people were killed by falling debris. The largest structural damage occurred at Boeing plants in Renton and southwestern Seattle, areas built on fill and mud flats. This earthquake prompted installation of the **Pacific Northwest Seismic Network** in 1969. ([DNR Earthquakes and Faults](https://dnr.wa.gov/washington-geological-survey/geologic-hazards-and-environment/earthquakes-and-faults))

### 2001 Nisqually earthquake (magnitude 6.8)

On February 28, 2001, a deep intraplate earthquake struck beneath Anderson Island at 52 km depth. No one was killed directly, though approximately 400 people were injured. Total damage reached an estimated $2 billion. ([PNSN](https://pnsn.org/education/pnw-earthquakes/notable/nisqually))

Key damage included:

- **Unreinforced masonry buildings** in Pioneer Square sustained the worst structural damage
- The **Alaskan Way Viaduct** sank several inches, catalyzing the $3.35 billion SR 99 tunnel replacement project ([WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/major-projects/alaskan-way-viaduct-replacement-program))
- **Sand boils and liquefaction** occurred in SODO and Harbor Island
- The Sea-Tac Airport air traffic control tower was heavily damaged

The Nisqually earthquake was a moderate event at a relatively deep focal depth. A shallow Seattle Fault earthquake of similar magnitude would produce substantially greater damage.

## Liquefaction zones

**Liquefaction** occurs when water-saturated, loosely packed soil loses its strength during earthquake shaking and behaves like a liquid. About 15% of Seattle's total area consists of soil prone to ground failure in earthquakes. ([Seattle OEM](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/earthquake))

### Most vulnerable areas

Seattle's highest-risk liquefaction zones sit on artificial fill placed over estuarine mud during the city's early 20th-century regrades, when hillsides were sluiced and fill was dumped into Elliott Bay and the Duwamish estuary. The most vulnerable neighborhoods include:

- **Duwamish Valley** (SODO, Georgetown, Harbor Island) -- experienced pervasive liquefaction during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, including sand boils, ground cracking, and pavement settlement
- **Pioneer Square** -- built on filled tideflats; sustained the worst building damage in 2001
- **Interbay** -- low-lying area between Queen Anne and Magnolia, built partly on fill
- **Rainier Valley** -- portions built on soft alluvial soils
- **Shoreline areas** -- waterfront zones across the city

### Infrastructure at risk

Both major north-south corridors (I-5 and SR 99/SR 509) pass through liquefaction zones. King County International Airport (Boeing Field) sits entirely within a liquefaction zone, as do most rail and marine terminals.

SDCI updated Seattle's Environmentally Critical Areas liquefaction-prone area map in 2023, replacing a map based on 1962 data with one using a 2005 geologic map and updated earthquake ground motions. ([SDCI Building Connections](https://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/2023/09/01/updated-liquefaction-prone-area-map/))

## Unreinforced masonry buildings

**Unreinforced masonry** (URM) buildings -- typically brick structures built before 1945 that lack steel reinforcement and structural connections -- are the most dangerous building type in earthquakes. Seattle has approximately **1,100 URM buildings**, and over **22,000 people** live or work in them. Pioneer Square and the Chinatown-International District together contain approximately 15% of all the city's URMs. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings))

SDCI estimates Seattle has an 86% chance of experiencing a damaging earthquake within 50 years. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings))

### Retrofit program timeline

Seattle's path toward mandatory URM retrofits has been gradual:

- **2001:** The Nisqually earthquake causes over $8 million in URM damage, renewing urgency
- **2017:** URM Policy Committee recommends the "Bolts Plus" retrofit standard ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2017/10/10/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-madrona-rezone/))
- **2021:** City Council passes Resolution 32033, directing SDCI to pursue a mandatory retrofit ordinance
- **November 2024:** Voluntary URM retrofit code adopted as part of the 2021 Seattle Existing Building Code, introducing an **Alternate Method for Retrofit** that reduces estimated costs by up to 70%
- **February 2025:** The Poll Building at 110 Union Street becomes the first building to receive official "Retrofitted" URM status
- **December 2025:** 76 URM buildings officially recognized as retrofitted (approximately 7% of all URMs) ([SDCI Building Connections](https://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/2025/12/01/76-unreinforced-masonry-buildings-officially-recognized-as-retrofitted/))
- **January 2026:** SDCI implements a 50% reduction in permit and plan review fees for seismic retrofit projects ([SDCI Building Connections](https://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/2026/01/05/cutting-costs-increasing-safety-new-fee-reductions-make-fixing-the-bricks-more-affordable-in-2026/))
- **Future:** Mandatory retrofit ordinance planned, with compliance timelines of 7 years (critical risk), 10 years (high vulnerability), and 13 years (medium vulnerability) after adoption

([Seattle SDCI URM Timeline](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings/timeline))

### What a retrofit involves

A URM seismic retrofit typically involves anchoring exterior walls to the roof and floor structures to prevent walls from falling outward during shaking. The "Bolts Plus" standard recommended for Seattle is a life-safety measure -- it does not guarantee a building will remain usable after a major earthquake, but it substantially reduces the risk of collapse and death. ([Seattle SDCI FAQ](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings/frequently-asked-questions))

### Retrofit costs and funding

Retrofit costs in Seattle can exceed $100 per square foot. The Alternate Method adopted in 2024 reduced estimated costs by up to 70%. The National Institute of Building Sciences estimates that every $1 invested in seismic retrofitting saves $13 in future losses. ([SDCI Building Connections](https://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/2026/01/05/cutting-costs-increasing-safety-new-fee-reductions-make-fixing-the-bricks-more-affordable-in-2026/))

Current and proposed funding mechanisms include:

- **FEMA grants** -- SDCI received a 2023 FEMA grant for retrofit cost-benefit analyses in the Chinatown-ID and Pioneer Square ([SDCI Project Documents](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings/project-documents))
- **C-PACER financing** -- authorized by state HB 2405, allows property owners to finance seismic upgrades through their property tax bill
- **Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)** -- proposed program to generate retrofit credits by selling unused development capacity from URM properties
- **Fee reductions** -- 50% permit and plan review fee reductions effective January 2026

### Comparison with other cities

| Feature | Seattle | Portland | Los Angeles |
|---|---|---|---|
| Number of URMs | ~1,100 | ~1,600 | ~8,000+ originally |
| Mandatory retrofit? | Not yet (planned) | Resolution passed 2018; stalled | Yes, since 1981 |
| Current status | Voluntary code adopted Nov 2024 | Working group disbanded 2020 | ~95% compliance by 1996 |
| Proposed compliance timelines | 7-13 years once mandatory | 20-30 years (proposed) | Phased, building-specific |

Studies of California cities found voluntary retrofit programs achieved only 19% compliance, while mandatory programs achieved substantially higher rates. ([Seattle SDCI FAQ](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings/frequently-asked-questions))

## Major seismic infrastructure investments

The Nisqually earthquake catalyzed two of Seattle's largest infrastructure projects:

- **Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement:** The $3.35 billion SR 99 tunnel, opened February 2019, replaced the seismically vulnerable double-deck viaduct. The tunnel meets standards for a 2,500-year earthquake. ([WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/major-projects/alaskan-way-viaduct-replacement-program))
- **Seawall rebuild:** A $350 million project to replace the deteriorating 1934 Alaskan Way Seawall, funded by a 2012 voter-approved bond. The original wooden supports had been consumed by marine organisms.

## State legislation

### House Bill 1810 (2025)

HB 1810 directs the Department of Commerce to study financial incentives for URM retrofits (tax modifications, exemptions, and support for schools and nonprofits) and the Emergency Management Division to create a statewide inventory of URM buildings. Preliminary report due June 2026; final report due September 2026. ([SDCI Building Connections](https://buildingconnections.seattle.gov/2025/02/04/support-house-bill-1810-urm-identification-and-retrofit-funding/))

### Other seismic legislation

- **Growth Management Act** (RCW 36.70A) requires cities and counties to identify geologically hazardous areas, including seismic hazard zones, and establish protective regulations
- **RCW 70.86** establishes earthquake standards for construction in Washington
- The **Resilient Washington State** framework, developed by the Emergency Management Council's Seismic Safety Subcommittee, provides a roadmap for minimizing earthquake losses

## Preparedness programs

### Seattle Office of Emergency Management (OEM)

OEM coordinates citywide earthquake preparedness, including guides for households, schools, and businesses. OEM recommends maintaining **7-10 days** of emergency supplies -- revised upward from the older 72-hour guideline after the Cascadia Rising exercises demonstrated that assistance could take days to reach affected areas. Washington state guidance now recommends **two weeks**. ([Seattle OEM](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/prepare/prepare-yourself))

### ShakeAlert earthquake early warning

**ShakeAlert**, developed by the USGS in collaboration with the University of Washington and other partners, provides seconds of advance warning before strong shaking arrives. The system went live in Washington state in 2021 and sends Wireless Emergency Alerts to all phones for earthquakes of magnitude 5.0+ with significant expected shaking. ([ShakeAlert](https://www.shakealert.org/) | [USGS ShakeAlert](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/shakealert/))

### Community Emergency Hubs

Seattle has over **136 designated gathering points** throughout the city, with over 70 staffed by neighborhood volunteers. First formed in 2007 after a major windstorm, hubs are volunteer-run centers for post-disaster communication and response. Approximately 150 licensed amateur radio operators serve as the emergency communication backbone. ([Seattle Emergency Hubs](https://seattleemergencyhubs.org/) | [Seattle OEM](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/prepare/prepare-your-neighborhood/community-emergency-hubs))

### Seattle Neighborhoods Actively Prepare (SNAP)

**SNAP** organizes neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness groups through OEM. Neighborhoods agree to work together following a major disaster, with assigned roles and designated meeting points. ([Seattle OEM](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/prepare/prepare-your-neighborhood/community-emergency-hubs))

### Cascadia Rising exercises

The **Cascadia Rising** exercise series simulates a magnitude 9.0 CSZ earthquake and tsunami. The 2016 exercise involved thousands of participants including military personnel across multiple states. The 2022 follow-up focused on critical transportation and mass care services. A key finding was that assistance would take days, not hours, to reach affected areas -- leading to the revised recommendation of two weeks of preparedness supplies.

### Great Washington ShakeOut

An annual statewide earthquake drill held each October. Over 1.2 million Washington residents registered for the 2025 drill. ([MRSC](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/october-2025/earthquake-preparedness))

## Earthquake insurance

Standard homeowners and renters insurance policies do **not** cover earthquake damage. Separate earthquake insurance must be purchased through private insurers. Washington has no state-run earthquake insurance authority equivalent to California's CEA. ([WA Insurance Commissioner](https://www.insurance.wa.gov/insurance-resources/home-insurance/insurance-natural-disasters/earthquake-insurance))

Key facts:

- Only about 11% of Washington residents have earthquake insurance coverage
- Deductibles typically range from 10-25% of the coverage amount
- Insurers may require property inspections or structural improvements (such as foundation bolting) before providing coverage
- Earthquake insurance does not typically cover floods, tsunamis, or landslides triggered by earthquakes

## Advocacy organizations

- **[ASAP! (Alliance for Safety, Affordability, and Preservation)](https://www.upgradeasap.com/):** The primary advocacy coalition pushing for mandatory URM retrofits in Seattle.
