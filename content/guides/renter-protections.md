# Renter Protections & Tenant Rights in Seattle

Seattle has one of the most extensive sets of tenant protections of any city in the United States. Combined with Washington State laws enacted in recent years, renters in Seattle have protections covering eviction, rent increases, housing inspections, screening, relocation assistance, and the right to legal representation. This guide covers the current framework, the history of how these protections developed, and where to find help.

About 54% of Seattle households rent their homes, according to [U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data](https://data.census.gov/). The city maintains the **Renting in Seattle** portal as a central resource for both renters and landlords. ([seattle.gov/rentinginseattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle))

## Current protections

### Just Cause Eviction Ordinance

Seattle's **Just Cause Eviction Ordinance** (SMC 22.206.160C) restricts landlords from ending a tenancy without one of 16 enumerated legal reasons. Landlords cannot issue no-cause eviction notices. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/just-cause-eviction-ordinance))

The just causes include:

- Failure to pay rent (after a 14-day pay-or-vacate notice)
- Habitual failure to pay rent (four or more notices in 12 months)
- Violation of the rental agreement (after a 10-day comply-or-vacate notice)
- Owner or immediate family member intends to occupy the unit (90-day notice required)
- Intent to sell a single-family home (90-day notice)
- Substantial rehabilitation or demolition (requires a Tenant Relocation License)
- Criminal activity on the premises

As of July 2021, landlords must also offer lease renewals to existing tenants unless they have a just cause reason not to. ([Renting in Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/renters/moving-out/just-cause-eviction-ordinance))

Washington State enacted statewide just cause eviction protections through **HB 1236** in 2021, codified at [RCW 59.18.650](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.650).

### Rent stabilization (statewide)

Washington's **HB 1217**, signed by Governor Bob Ferguson on May 7, 2025, established statewide rent stabilization. Washington became the third state (after Oregon and California) to enact such a law. ([WA Legislature](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=1217&year=2025))

Key provisions:

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Annual cap | 7% + CPI, or 10%, whichever is lower |
| First-year protection | No rent increases during the first 12 months of tenancy |
| Statewide notice period | 90 days (increased from 60) |
| Manufactured homes | Capped at 5% per year (permanent, no sunset) |
| New construction exemption | 12 years from certificate of occupancy |
| Enforcement | Attorney General under Consumer Protection Act; up to $7,500 per violation |
| Sunset | 15 years for residential caps; manufactured home caps are permanent |

The 2026 maximum rent increase is 9.683% (7% + 2.683% CPI). The Department of Commerce announces the annual cap each July. ([Governor's signing announcement](https://governor.wa.gov/news/2025/governor-ferguson-signs-rent-stabilization-affordable-housing-bills) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/05/08/rent-stabilization-parking-reforms-become-law-in-washington/))

### 180-day rent increase notice

Seattle requires landlords to provide a minimum of **180 days' advance written notice** before any rent increase — significantly longer than the state's 90-day requirement. No rent increases are allowed during the first 12 months of a tenancy. ([Renting in Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/renters/managing-the-rental-relationship/receiving-notice-from-your-landlord))

For increases of **10% or more** in a 12-month period, landlords must hand-deliver or send the notice by both certified and regular mail and include information about **Economic Displacement Relocation Assistance** (EDRA).

### Relocation assistance

Two programs provide financial assistance to tenants displaced from their housing:

**Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance (TRAO, SMC 22.210):** Requires landlords to pay relocation assistance to low-income tenants (below 50% [AMI]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#ami-area-median-income" >}})) displaced by demolition, substantial rehabilitation, change of use, or removal of use restrictions. The 2025 amount is **$5,354 per eligible household**, split 50/50 between the property owner and the City. Tenants receive 90 days' notice before they must vacate. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/tenant-relocation-assistance-ordinance))

**Economic Displacement Relocation Assistance (EDRA, SMC 22.212):** Effective July 1, 2022, EDRA covers tenants displaced by rent increases of 10% or more in a 12-month period. Eligible tenants (at or below 80% AMI) who vacate before the increase takes effect can receive up to **three months of current housing cost**. ([Renting in Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/renters/moving-out/economic-displacement-relocation-assistance))

### Rental Registration and Inspection Ordinance (RRIO)

Since 2012, all rental property owners in Seattle must **register their properties** with the city and submit to **periodic inspections** to ensure units meet minimum housing safety standards (SMC 22.214). ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/licensing-and-registration/rental-registration-and-inspection-ordinance))

- Properties are inspected at least once every 5–10 years
- Inspectors check structural soundness, heating, electrical safety, emergency egress, and hazardous materials
- Owners of multi-unit buildings may inspect a sample of 20% of units
- Registration must be renewed every two years

### First-in-time screening rule

Seattle's **first-in-time rule** (SMC 14.08.050) requires landlords to screen rental applicants in the chronological order applications are received and offer tenancy to the first qualified applicant. Landlords must publish their screening criteria before accepting applications. ([Seattle Office for Civil Rights](https://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/housing-rights/tenant-screening-rules))

The rule took effect January 1, 2017 and is enforced by the Seattle Office for Civil Rights. Applicants have 48 hours to accept an offer; landlords must move to the next qualified applicant if declined.

### Source of income discrimination protections

Seattle prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants based on their source of income, including **Section 8 vouchers**, Social Security, unemployment benefits, child support, disability benefits, and other non-employment income (SMC 14.08). When calculating income thresholds, landlords must subtract the subsidy amount from the rent and apply the income test only to the tenant's portion. ([Seattle Office for Civil Rights](https://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/housing-rights/source-of-income-protections/faq-alternative-source-of-income-subsidies-and-preferred-employer-programs))

Washington State also provides statewide source of income protections under [RCW 59.18.255](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.255), with penalties of up to 4.5 times the monthly rent.

### Right to counsel

Since March 2021 (Ordinance 126082), all **indigent tenants facing eviction** in Seattle have a right to free legal representation. Washington State enacted statewide right to counsel through **SB 5160** in April 2021, the first state in the nation to do so. The **Housing Justice Project** at the King County Bar Association is the primary provider of eviction defense services. ([Tenants Union](https://tenantsunion.org/rights/right-to-counsel-in-eviction-proceedings))

### Seasonal eviction protections

**Winter eviction ban (Ordinance 126041):** Passed February 2020, this provides a defense to eviction between **December 1 and March 1** for low- and moderate-income tenants of landlords with five or more units in Seattle who face eviction for nonpayment. Courts can dismiss or stay proceedings until March 1. Exceptions exist for threats to health and safety, criminal activity, and owner-occupancy.

**School year eviction protection (Ordinance 126369):** Passed June 2021, this protects households with children in school (daycare through high school), school employees, and anyone enrolled in school from eviction during the **Seattle Public Schools school year** (approximately September through mid-June).

Together these seasonal protections mean most physical evictions in Seattle for nonpayment of rent occur between late June and November. ([Renting in Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/housing-providers/moving-a-tenant-out/defenses-to-eviction))

### Additional protections

- **Late fees** are capped at $10 per month
- **Move-in costs** cannot exceed one month's rent; tenants may request installment payments over six months
- **Algorithmic rent pricing** is restricted under CB 121000 (effective July 31, 2025), limiting the use of software algorithms to set rental prices
- **Criminal record screening** is limited to checking the sex offender registry with a legitimate business reason; individualized assessment is required (SMC 14.09)

## History

### 1980: Just Cause Eviction Ordinance

Seattle passed the **Just Cause Eviction Ordinance**, one of the earliest in the country, restricting landlords from ending tenancies without enumerated legal reasons. The ordinance has been amended multiple times since. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/just-cause-eviction-ordinance))

### 1990: Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance

The City Council passed the **Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance** (SMC 22.210), requiring landlords to compensate low-income tenants displaced by demolition, rehabilitation, or change of use. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/tenant-relocation-assistance-ordinance))

### 2012: Rental Registration and Inspection Ordinance

After a campaign led by the **Tenants Union of Washington State**, the City Council passed **RRIO**, requiring all rental properties to register with the city and submit to periodic safety inspections. ([Seattle SDCI](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/licensing-and-registration/rental-registration-and-inspection-ordinance))

### 2016: Source of income protections expanded

Seattle expanded source of income discrimination protections in SMC 14.08 to cover all alternative sources of income, building on existing protections for Section 8 voucher holders that had been in place since the late 1990s. ([Seattle Office for Civil Rights](https://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/housing-rights/source-of-income-protections/faq-alternative-source-of-income-subsidies-and-preferred-employer-programs))

### 2017: First-in-time screening rule

The **first-in-time rule** took effect, requiring landlords to screen applicants chronologically and offer tenancy to the first qualified applicant. ([Seattle Office for Civil Rights](https://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/housing-rights/tenant-screening-rules))

### 2020: Winter eviction ban and COVID-19 moratorium

In February, the City Council passed the **winter eviction ban** (December 1 through March 1). In March, Mayor Durkan declared a civil emergency and imposed an **eviction moratorium** that was extended six times through January 15, 2022. Washington State had a parallel moratorium from March 2020 through October 2021. ([Cascade PBS](https://www.cascadepbs.org/politics/2022/03/seattles-eviction-moratorium-ended-some-protections-remain/))

### 2021: Right to counsel, school year protections, and statewide just cause

A wave of tenant protection legislation passed at both levels:

- **March 2021:** Seattle enacted the **right to counsel** for indigent tenants facing eviction (Ordinance 126082)
- **April 2021:** Washington enacted statewide **right to counsel** (SB 5160) and statewide **just cause eviction** (HB 1236)
- **June 2021:** Seattle passed **school year eviction protections** (Ordinance 126369)
- **November 2021:** Seattle's **180-day rent increase notice** requirement took effect

### 2022: Economic Displacement Relocation Assistance

**EDRA** (SMC 22.212) took effect on July 1, extending relocation assistance to tenants displaced by rent increases of 10% or more. ([Renting in Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/renters/moving-out/economic-displacement-relocation-assistance))

### 2025: Statewide rent stabilization

Governor Ferguson signed **HB 1217** on May 7, 2025, capping annual rent increases at 7% plus CPI (maximum 10%) statewide. The law ended a ban on rent caps that had been in place since 1981. ([WA Legislature](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=1217&year=2025) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/05/08/rent-stabilization-parking-reforms-become-law-in-washington/))
