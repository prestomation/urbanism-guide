# Rainier Valley

The Rainier Valley is a seven-mile corridor stretching southeast from downtown Seattle to Lake Washington, home to some of the city's most racially and linguistically diverse neighborhoods. It is also where policy debates over transit investment, [displacement]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#displacement" >}}), and equitable development play out in concrete terms: Link light rail runs at-grade down the center of Martin Luther King Jr. Way S, property values near stations have risen hundreds of percent since construction began, and community organizations are working to ensure long-time residents are not priced out. This guide covers the valley's sub-neighborhoods, demographics, history, transit infrastructure, development patterns, anti-displacement tools, and current planning efforts.

## Sub-neighborhoods

The Rainier Valley encompasses several distinct neighborhoods, running roughly north to south:

- **North Rainier / Mount Baker** -- The valley's northern gateway, centered on the Mount Baker Link light rail station and the commercial intersection of Rainier Avenue S and S McClellan Street. Designated as an Urban Center under the [One Seattle Plan]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#comprehensive-plan" >}}). ([Seattle OPCD: One Seattle Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan))
- **Columbia City** -- A historic commercial district centered on Rainier Avenue S between S Alaska Street and S Edmunds Street, designated a [Landmark District]({{< relref "historic-preservation" >}}) in 1978 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same year. ([Seattle Dept. of Neighborhoods: Columbia City Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/columbia-city-landmark-district))
- **Hillman City** -- A primarily residential neighborhood between Columbia City and Rainier Beach, centered on Rainier Avenue S near S Graham Street. The planned Graham Street infill light rail station will serve this area. ([Sound Transit: Graham Street Station](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/graham-street-station))
- **Brighton and Dunlap** -- Residential neighborhoods east of MLK Jr. Way S, between Columbia City and Rainier Beach. Dunlap had the highest diversity index score (76.7) of any Seattle neighborhood in the 2020 Census. ([Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/where-does-your-seattle-neighborhood-fall-in-this-diversity-index-check-the-map/))
- **Othello** -- A neighborhood centered on the Othello Link light rail station, anchored by the **Othello Square** mixed-use campus and the **NewHolly** mixed-income housing community. ([HomeSight: Othello Square](https://homesightwa.org/othello-square/))
- **Rainier Beach** -- The valley's southernmost neighborhood, bordering Lake Washington and Renton. Home to significant Somali, Ethiopian, and Vietnamese communities. ([Seattle OPCD: Rainier Beach](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/rainier-beach))

## Demographics

### Diversity

ZIP code **98118**, which covers approximately six square miles of the Rainier Valley, has approximately **50,500 residents**. No single racial group holds a majority. According to the 2020 Census, the population is approximately 39% white, 24% Asian, 18% Black, 11% Hispanic/Latino, and 6% two or more races. ([Census Reporter: 98118](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US98118-98118/))

The valley has been widely described as "the most diverse ZIP code in America," though the Census Bureau does not make such designations. A 2012 analysis using the Gini-Simpson diversity index ranked 98118 as the **3rd most diverse ZIP code in Washington** and **64th** among approximately 17,000 metropolitan ZIP codes nationwide. ([HistoryLink: 98118 Neighborhood of Nations](https://www.historylink.org/File/10164))

Within the valley, diversity varies by sub-neighborhood. In the 2020 Census, Dunlap scored 76.7 on the diversity index (Seattle's highest), Columbia City scored 75.7, and both exceeded the citywide average of 60.1. ([Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/where-does-your-seattle-neighborhood-fall-in-this-diversity-index-check-the-map/))

### Languages

Residents of 98118 speak **59 languages**. In local schools, **56% of students** come from homes where a language other than English is the primary language, compared to 23% district-wide. The most commonly spoken non-English languages include Chinese, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese, Amharic, and Tagalog. ([HistoryLink: 98118 Neighborhood of Nations](https://www.historylink.org/File/10164))

### Income

The median household income in 98118 is approximately **$113,762**, below Seattle's citywide median of approximately $122,000. The poverty rate is **11.6%**, above the citywide rate of approximately 10%. Sub-neighborhoods vary: Rainier Beach had a median household income of **$43,041** in the 2009-2013 period (vs. $65,277 citywide), though incomes have risen substantially since. ([Census Reporter: 98118](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US98118-98118/) | [Seattle Neighborhood Snapshot: Rainier Beach (PDF)](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/Districts/Neighborhood%20Snapshots/Rainier-Beach-Snapshot.pdf))

### Housing tenure

Approximately **57% of housing units** in 98118 are owner-occupied, higher than Seattle's citywide homeownership rate of approximately 46%. The median owner-occupied home value is **$810,500**. However, homeownership rates vary sharply by race: citywide, 50% of white households own their homes, compared to 43% of Asian households, 29% of Hispanic/Latino households, and 22% of Black households. ([Census Reporter: 98118](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US98118-98118/) | [Seattle RSJI: Racial Demographics](https://www.seattle.gov/rsji/racial-equity-research/racial-demographics))

## History

### 1889-1891: Streetcar suburb

The **Rainier Avenue Electric Railway**, established by banker J. K. Edmiston in 1889, reached Columbia City by 1891. The streetcar line transformed what historian Leslie Blanchard called an "almost uninhabited wilderness" into a residential corridor. The first lots in Columbia City were sold from a canvas tent on April 4, 1891. Frank Osgood extended the line to Renton in 1896, creating King County's first interurban rail service. ([HistoryLink: Rainier Valley Thumbnail History](https://www.historylink.org/file/3092) | [HistoryLink: Columbia City Thumbnail History](https://www.historylink.org/File/3327))

### Early 1900s: Italian and Japanese immigration

Coal mining jobs and cheap land outside city limits attracted Italian immigrants, who planted large produce gardens. The north valley became known as **"Garlic Gulch."** By 1910, 3,454 people of Italian heritage lived in Seattle, concentrated in the Rainier Valley. Japanese immigrants (Issei) also purchased plots in the valley. Seattle annexed the valley in 1907. ([HistoryLink: Rainier Valley Thumbnail History](https://www.historylink.org/file/3092))

### 1937: End of the streetcar era

The last Rainier Avenue interurban car ran at 1:45 a.m. on January 1, 1937, ending 46 years of private streetcar service. The rails were removed and paved over to widen Rainier Avenue S. ([HistoryLink: Seattle Renton & Southern Railway](https://www.historylink.org/File/1756))

### 1940s: Wartime demographic shifts

During World War II, Japanese American residents were forcibly relocated to internment camps. The federal government built thousands of temporary housing units at **Rainier Vista**, **Stadium Homes**, and **Holly Park** for war workers. African Americans, previously confined to the Central Area by [racially restrictive covenants]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#racially-restrictive-covenants" >}}) and discriminatory real estate practices, began moving southward into the valley. The 1968 open housing ordinance expanded their movement further. ([HistoryLink: Rainier Valley Thumbnail History](https://www.historylink.org/file/3092))

### 1970s-2000s: Waves of immigration

Southeast Asian refugees arrived after the fall of Saigon in 1975, followed by East African immigrants and refugees (Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean) in subsequent decades. Immigrants from the Middle East, India, and Latin America also settled in the valley. By the 2000 Census, the valley had become one of the most racially diverse neighborhoods in the nation. ([HistoryLink: Rainier Valley Thumbnail History](https://www.historylink.org/file/3092))

### 1978: Columbia City Landmark District

Columbia City's commercial core was designated a **Landmark District** and simultaneously listed on the **National Register of Historic Places**. The district preserves a collection of commercial buildings, churches, apartments, and houses centered on a "village green" with a 1914 Andrew Carnegie library branch. ([Seattle Dept. of Neighborhoods: Columbia City Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/columbia-city-landmark-district))

### 1999: Save Our Valley lawsuit

Sound Transit selected an at-grade alignment on MLK Jr. Way S for the initial Link light rail line, a decision that saved approximately $400 million compared to a tunnel. A community group called **Save Our Valley** sued, alleging the decision to use a cheaper surface option through the majority-minority Rainier Valley violated federal civil rights and environmental laws. The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in 2001, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed dismissal in 2003. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/federal-judge-dismisses-final-claim-sov-lawsuit) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2019/08/06/every-40-days-train-collisions-happen-in-the-rainier-valley/))

### 2009: Link light rail opens

Central Link began revenue service on **July 18, 2009**, with a ribbon-cutting at Mount Baker Station. The at-grade segment through the Rainier Valley is 4.3 miles of double track in the median of MLK Jr. Way S, built under a **$128 million construction contract**. The road was widened 15 feet on each side, and approximately 100 structures were demolished for the widening. Sound Transit's Board had approved a **$50 million transit-oriented community development fund** for the Rainier Valley in response to community concerns about disruption. ([HistoryLink](https://www.historylink.org/file/20711) | [Herzog](https://www.herzog.com/project/rainier-valley-central-link-light-rail-project/) | [South Seattle Emerald](https://southseattleemerald.org/news/2021/11/09/light-rail-in-the-rainier-valley-10-years-later))

### 2014: Mount Baker station area rezone

The City Council rezoned **109 parcels** in a 37-acre area surrounding Mount Baker station, raising height limits from 65 feet to **125 feet**. The 8-1 vote created the Mount Baker Station Area Overlay District with Seattle Mixed zoning designations. ([Seattle City Council](https://council.seattle.gov/2014/06/24/north-rainier-hub-urban-village-and-the-mount-baker-station-area-overlay-district/))

### 2020: Sound Transit surplus property transfer

The Sound Transit Board approved the no-cost transfer of **10 surplus property sites** in the Rainier Valley to the City of Seattle for affordable homeownership development. The sites, located within a half mile of Othello, Columbia City, and Mount Baker stations, were appraised at **$9.4 million**. ([Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-board-approves-transfer-surplus-property-no))

## Transit

### Link light rail

The [1 Line]({{< relref "light-rail" >}}) serves three stations in the Rainier Valley -- **Columbia City**, **Othello**, and **Rainier Beach** -- plus **Mount Baker** at the valley's northern edge. The at-grade segment runs 4.2 miles with **27 at-grade crossings** (18 allowing vehicle crossings, 10 pedestrian-only). Trains operate every 6 minutes at peak. ([Sound Transit: 1 Line](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules/1-line))

Approximate weekday boardings (mid-2025): Columbia City ~2,300, Othello ~2,600, Rainier Beach ~1,800. About 75% of passengers at Columbia City board northbound toward downtown. ([Seattle Transit Blog](https://seattletransitblog.com/2025/08/25/ridership-patterns-for-link-1-line/))

### At-grade safety

Since 2009, light rail vehicles have been involved in at least **136 collisions** with vehicles, people, or objects in the Rainier Valley. **Eight of the system's 11 fatalities** from train strikes occurred on this at-grade segment. Illegal left turns by drivers account for **63%** of all collisions. Sound Transit is spending **$14-21 million** on pedestrian gates at Columbia City and Othello stations, targeted for completion by mid-2026. Sound Transit has stated that all future Link extensions will be fully grade-separated. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/12/02/sound-transit-rainier-valley-safety-plan/) | [Sound Transit: At-Grade Crossing Safety](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-seeks-input-grade-crossing-safety))

### Graham Street infill station

Sound Transit is planning an infill station at **S Graham Street** on MLK Jr. Way S, filling a 1.6-mile gap between Columbia City and Othello stations. The station was originally included in Sound Transit's 1999 plans but deferred, then funded by the [ST3]({{< relref "/glossary/transportation#st3-sound-transit-3" >}}) ballot measure in 2016. In March 2025, Sound Transit selected a center-platform design south of the intersection. Pre-pandemic ridership estimates projected up to **2,500 daily riders**. The cost estimate has risen from $124 million to **$175-200 million**, with opening targeted for **2031**. ([Sound Transit: Graham Street Station](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/graham-street-station) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/03/17/sound-transit-graham-street-station/) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/11/17/escalating-costs-could-push-sound-transit-to-reconsider-two-infill-stations/))

OPCD launched a [station area planning]({{< relref "station-area-planning" >}}) process for Graham Street in 2025, with a three-phase community engagement model targeting a Community Action Plan by late 2026. ([Seattle OPCD: Graham Street](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/current-projects/graham-street))

### Rainier Avenue bus service

**Route 7** on Rainier Avenue S serves over **9,000 daily riders**, making it one of the highest-ridership bus routes in Seattle. King County Metro plans to upgrade it to the **RapidRide R Line** with bus-only lanes, all-door boarding, and improved stations. The project was paused in 2020 due to pandemic revenue losses and has been delayed multiple times; the current target opening is approximately **2032**. The budget was reduced 25%, from $123 million to **$91.2 million**. SDOT completed interim improvements in 2023 as part of the Route 7 Transit-Plus Multimodal Corridor project, including bus-only lanes, new signals, and pedestrian crossings. ([King County Metro: RapidRide R Line](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/bus/rapidride/r-line) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/17/metro-scales-back-scope-of-rapidride-k-r-lines/) | [SDOT: Route 7 Transit-Plus](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/transit-program/transit-plus-multimodal-corridor-program/route-7---transit-plus))

### Rainier Avenue safety

Rainier Avenue S is part of SDOT's **High Injury Network** -- the subset of streets where the most serious and fatal crashes occur. Council District 2, which includes the Rainier Valley, accounts for a disproportionate share of the city's traffic fatalities. In 2015, SDOT implemented a one-mile pilot road diet between S Alaska Street and S Kenny Street, resulting in a **15% reduction in total crashes**, a **30% reduction in injury crashes**, and a **40% reduction in pedestrian and bicycle crashes**. ([FHWA: Rainier Avenue South Redesign](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/learn-safety/noteworthy-practices/rainier-avenue-south-redesign-seattle-washington) | [SDOT: Rainier Improvements](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero/projects/rainier-improvements))

## Displacement and gentrification

### Rising property values

The Puget Sound Regional Council reported that assessed land values around light rail stations in the Rainier Valley rose an average of **513%** between 2004 and 2011. During the same period, rents in the valley doubled from approximately **$500 to over $1,000 per month**. ([Puget Sound Sage](https://pugetsoundsage.org/rising-rents-gentrification-threaten-equitable-economic-growth-in-rainier-valley/))

### Demographic shifts

Between 2000 and 2010, the white population in 98118 grew by approximately **17%**, while the minority population grew only **5%** -- well below King County's 47% growth rate for communities of color. Between the 2010 and 2020 Census, the valley lost hundreds of Black residents even as its total population grew by thousands. Many displaced Black families relocated to South King County communities including Federal Way, Kent, Renton, and Tukwila. ([Puget Sound Sage](https://pugetsoundsage.org/rising-rents-gentrification-threaten-equitable-economic-growth-in-rainier-valley/) | [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/5-census-takeaways-when-it-comes-to-race-ethnicity-in-seattle-2020-data-tells-us-whos-moving-in-whos-moving-out/))

Seattle's Growth and Equity Analysis classifies Rainier Valley neighborhoods as **high displacement risk areas** based on demographic vulnerability, housing market pressures, and development capacity. ([Seattle OPCD: Displacement Risk Indicators](https://population-and-demographics-seattlecitygis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/displacement-risk))

### Small business displacement

Rising commercial rents have affected small businesses along Rainier Avenue S, particularly Black-owned and immigrant-owned establishments. Commercial displacement often precedes residential displacement. Organizations including **SEACap** -- a partnership of HomeSight, Ventures, and Rainier Valley Community Development Fund -- provide affordable capital for low-income immigrants, refugees, and people of color in South Seattle. ([Cascade PBS](https://www.cascadepbs.org/equity/2023/11/rainier-beachs-black-led-organizations-battle-gentrification/) | [HomeSight: SEACap](https://homesightwa.org/seacap/))

## Anti-displacement investments

### Rainier Valley Affordable Homeownership Initiative

The City of Seattle launched the **Rainier Valley Affordable Homeownership Initiative (RVAHI)** using 10 parcels transferred from Sound Transit at no cost (appraised at $9.4 million). The goal is to create at least **100 permanently affordable for-sale homes** for first-time homebuyers earning 80% of [AMI]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#ami-area-median-income" >}}) or below. The City committed approximately **$10 million** to fund the initiative. Developer partners include **Homestead [Community Land Trust]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#community-land-trust-clt" >}})**, **Rainier Beach Action Coalition**, **African Community Housing & Development**, and **Habitat for Humanity**. The first completed homes were sold and occupied by late 2025, with additional phases under construction through 2030. ([Seattle Office of Housing: RVAHI](https://www.seattle.gov/housing/programs-and-initiatives/rainier-valley-affordable-homeownership-initiative) | [Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-board-approves-transfer-surplus-property-no))

### Othello Square

**Othello Square** is a 3.2-acre, multi-building campus adjacent to the Othello Link station, developed by **HomeSight**. The campus includes:

- **Building A (Opportunity Center):** 213 affordable housing units with HomeSight's community-serving offices on the ground floor
- **Building C (Orenda):** 176 units (72 affordable via MFTE at 65-80% AMI), with the **Odessa Brown Children's Clinic** on the lower floors
- **Building D (U-lex Co-op):** 68 units of limited-equity cooperative housing, affordable at 80% AMI or below, with 50% of units reserved for Southeast Seattle stakeholders

([HomeSight: Othello Square](https://homesightwa.org/othello-square/) | [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/with-othello-square-a-rainier-valley-community-gets-some-help-in-the-battle-against-gentrification/))

### Mount Baker redevelopment

The City of Seattle selected **El Centro de la Raza** and **Mercy Housing Northwest** to develop **431 affordable homes** on City-owned properties near Mount Baker station. Thirty percent of homes are reserved for families at or below 30% AMI, and 60% will be family-sized. The site also includes the UW Rainier Valley Early Learning Campus. ([Mayor's Office](https://harrell.seattle.gov/2024/07/09/city-of-seattle-selects-affordable-housing-partners-for-mount-baker-redevelopment/))

### Equitable Development Initiative projects

The [Equitable Development Initiative]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#equitable-development-initiative-edi" >}}) has funded multiple projects in the Rainier Valley, including:

- **Rainier Beach Action Coalition Food Innovation Center** -- land purchase and facility development for a food business incubator
- **Tubman Center for Health & Freedom** -- health clinic at Graham Street
- **Somali Community Cultural Innovation Hub** -- multigenerational community center
- **Hillman City Hub (SEED)** -- creative and cultural space anchoring the Rainier Valley Creative District
- **Columbia City Theater** -- ADA renovations for a historic cultural venue
- **Rainier Valley Midwives Birth and Health Center**

([Mayor's Office: EDI Awards](https://harrell.seattle.gov/2023/05/05/mayor-harrell-announces-13-5-million-to-community-organizations-through-the-equitable-development-initiative/) | [Seattle OPCD: EDI](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/current-projects/equitable-development-initiative))

### Community Preference Policy

The City's [Community Preference Policy]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#community-preference-policy" >}}) allows affordable housing developments in high-displacement-risk areas to prioritize applicants with ties to the neighborhood -- current residents, former residents, and their family members. RVAHI projects use this policy. ([Seattle Office of Housing: Community Preference](https://www.seattle.gov/housing/programs-and-initiatives/community-preference))

## Current zoning and planning

### Mandatory Housing Affordability

[MHA]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#mha-mandatory-housing-affordability" >}}) zoning applies across the valley's commercial and multifamily zones. Because Rainier Valley is classified as a higher displacement-risk area, the city applied the more moderate **(M)** tier around light rail stations rather than the M1 or M2 tiers used elsewhere, aiming to limit displacement pressure. ([HUD Cityscape: Evidence From Seattle's Affordable Housing Mandate (PDF)](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol25num2/ch11.pdf))

### One Seattle Plan designations

The **One Seattle Comprehensive Plan**, adopted by City Council on December 16, 2025, assigns new place-type designations to Rainier Valley neighborhoods:

- **Mount Baker:** Urban Center
- **Columbia City:** Urban Center
- **Othello:** Urban Center
- **Rainier Beach:** Urban Center

The plan also designates Rainier Beach for a rezone near the light rail station from SM-RB 55 to **SM-RB 125** (125-foot height limit). The plan's [Anti-Displacement Framework]({{< relref "environmental-justice" >}}) aims to balance growth with protections for existing residents. ([Seattle OPCD: One Seattle Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan) | [Seattle OPCD: One Seattle Plan Zoning Update FAQ (PDF)](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/OPCD/SeattlePlan/OneSeattlePlanZoningUpdateFAQ.pdf))

### HB 1491 compliance

Washington's 2025 [transit-oriented development law]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#hb-1491-transit-oriented-development" >}}) requires a minimum average [FAR]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#far-floor-area-ratio" >}}) of 3.5 within a half-mile walking distance of light rail stations. Areas where existing MHA zoning already meets this threshold will not need further [upzoning]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#upzoning" >}}). Seattle must comply by December 31, 2029. ([Seattle OPCD: One Seattle Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan))

### Rainier Beach neighborhood plan

The Rainier Beach neighborhood plan was originally completed in 1999 and updated in **March 2012** after light rail arrived. Key initiatives include a **Food Innovation District** near the Rainier Beach station, the **Rainier Beach Urban Farm & Wetlands**, and an emphasis on locally produced goods and living-wage jobs. The plan won an **American Planning Association National Planning Achievement Award** in 2013. ([Seattle OPCD: Rainier Beach](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/rainier-beach))

## Cultural assets

The Rainier Valley's cultural identity is shaped by its immigrant and refugee communities:

- **Vietnamese businesses** extend along MLK Jr. Way S, established by immigrants who arrived after 1975. The nearby **Little Saigon** district on S Jackson Street serves over 40,000 Vietnamese Americans in the region. ([Seattle OPCD: Little Saigon](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/vault/little-saigon-business-district))
- **Somali and East African communities** are concentrated in Rainier Beach and Othello, with community institutions including **East African Community Services** and the planned **Somali Community Cultural Innovation Hub**. ([HistoryLink: 98118 Neighborhood of Nations](https://www.historylink.org/File/10164))
- **Ethiopian restaurants and businesses** are concentrated along Rainier Avenue S, reflecting a community that has received [EDI]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#equitable-development-initiative-edi" >}}) funding for cultural space development. ([Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/rainier-valley-birth-center-ethiopian-community-center-among-seattle-projects-awarded-equitable-development-grants/))
- The **Columbia City Landmark District** preserves turn-of-the-century commercial architecture and hosts a year-round farmers market, independent businesses, and the Columbia City Theater.
