# Regional Governance & Agency Coordination

The Puget Sound region's transportation and land use decisions are made by a web of overlapping agencies -- cities, counties, transit operators, a regional council, and a state department of transportation. No single entity controls the system. This guide explains who does what, how decisions get made, and where the agencies coordinate (or don't).

## The agencies

### Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC)

**[PSRC](https://www.psrc.org/)** is the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the four-county central Puget Sound region: King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Kitsap counties. It is also the state-designated Regional Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO) and a federal Economic Development District (EDD). PSRC has [more than 100 member entities](https://www.psrc.org/about-us/member-organizations) including 4 counties, approximately 80 cities, 4 tribal nations, 6 transit agencies, 4 port districts, and WSDOT. ([PSRC About](https://www.psrc.org/about-us))

PSRC does not build or operate anything. Its power comes from two roles:

1. **Growth planning:** PSRC adopts the region's long-range growth strategy, **[VISION 2050](https://www.psrc.org/planning-2050/vision-2050)**, which projects the region will grow to 5.8 million people by 2050 and directs 65% of population growth and 75% of job growth to regional growth centers and high-capacity transit corridors. VISION 2050 shapes every city's [comprehensive plan]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#comprehensive-plan" >}}) by setting countywide growth targets that cities must plan to accommodate.

2. **Federal funding allocation:** As the MPO, PSRC distributes approximately $300 million annually in federal transportation dollars from FHWA and FTA to local projects through a competitive selection process. Projects must be included in PSRC's **Regional Transportation Plan** and **Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)** to receive federal funding. ([PSRC Transportation](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/transportation))

**Governance:** PSRC is governed by a **General Assembly** of all members (highest decision-making body, meets annually), a 36-member **Executive Board** that acts on the General Assembly's behalf, and two policy boards: the **Transportation Policy Board** and the **Growth Management Policy Board**. All board seats are held by elected officials from member jurisdictions. ([PSRC About](https://www.psrc.org/about-us))

### Sound Transit

**[Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/)** is the regional transit authority for the three-county district of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties (Kitsap County is not part of Sound Transit's district). Sound Transit builds and operates Link light rail, Sounder commuter rail, ST Express buses, and the upcoming Stride BRT lines. For details on the system itself, see the **[Link Light Rail]({{< relref "light-rail" >}})** and **[Mass Transit]({{< relref "mass-transit" >}})** guides.

**Board:** Sound Transit is governed by an [18-member Board of Directors](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/board-directors) made up of local elected officials, not directly elected transit commissioners. Seats are allocated proportionally to population: 10 from King County, 4 from Pierce County, 3 from Snohomish County, and 1 seat for the Washington State Secretary of Transportation. County executives appoint most board members from among elected officials within their county. ([Sound Transit Board](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/board-directors))

**Funding:** Sound Transit's capital program is funded through three voter-approved tax packages (ST1 in 1996, ST2 in 2008, ST3 in 2016) totaling over $71 billion in authorized spending. Revenue comes from a 1.4% sales tax, $0.25 per $1,000 property tax, and a 1.1% motor vehicle excise tax (MVET) within the district. ([Sound Transit Funding](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/paying-regional-transit))

**Subarea equity:** Sound Transit's district is divided into five subareas -- North King, South King, East King, Snohomish, and Pierce -- and tax revenue raised in each subarea must be spent on projects and services that benefit that subarea. This policy, called **subarea equity**, is legally binding and independently audited. It ensures that suburbs fund suburban projects and urban areas fund urban projects, but it also means wealthier subareas like East King generate more revenue per capita than South King. ([Sound Transit Regional Tax Information](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/paying-regional-transit/regional-tax-information))

### King County Metro

**[King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro)** is the primary bus operator within King County and the 8th-largest transit bus agency in the United States. Metro operates 143 fixed routes using approximately 1,400 vehicles, carried 88.9 million passengers in 2024, and also operates the Seattle Streetcar, King County Water Taxi, and paratransit services. See the **[Mass Transit]({{< relref "mass-transit" >}})** guide for full system details.

**Governance:** Unlike Sound Transit, Metro is not an independent agency. It is a **division of King County government**, which means the King County Executive manages it and the King County Council controls its budget and policies. This structure means Metro's priorities are shaped by countywide politics, not just transit riders.

The **[Regional Transit Committee](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/council/governance-leadership/county-council/committees/regional-transit-committee)** (RTC) reviews and makes recommendations to the King County Council on countywide transit policies, the Strategic Plan for Public Transportation, Metro Service Guidelines, and the **Metro Connects** long-range plan. The RTC has approximately 15 members: 3 King County Councilmembers, 10 city representatives appointed by the Sound Cities Association, and 2 Seattle City Councilmembers. ([King County RTC](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/council/governance-leadership/county-council/committees/regional-transit-committee))

**Funding:** Metro is funded primarily by a 0.9% sales tax within King County, supplemented by property tax, state and federal grants, and fares (approximately 8% of revenue). The **Seattle Transit Measure** (approved 2020) adds a 0.15% Seattle sales tax generating over $50 million annually for Metro service in Seattle. ([King County Metro Blog](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/24/approved-king-county-metros-2026-27-budget-adds-service-invests-in-zero-emissions-safety-and-cleaning/))

**Key planning document:** **[Metro Connects](https://kingcounty.gov/en/-/media/king-county/depts/metro/documents/about/policies/2021-11-17-metro-connects.pdf)** is Metro's 30-year vision for the bus network, envisioning 70% more service by 2050 and an eventual network of 26 RapidRide lines (A through Z).

### Community Transit

**[Community Transit](https://www.communitytransit.org/)** serves Snohomish County (excluding the city of Everett, which operates Everett Transit). Community Transit operates local bus service, three **Swift** BRT lines, and paratransit. In September 2024, Community Transit [restructured its entire network](https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/09/12/fall-2024-transit-service-changes-include-big-shakeups/) to feed Lynnwood Link light rail stations, eliminating nearly all express bus service to downtown Seattle.

**Governance:** Community Transit is governed by a board of directors made up of elected officials from Snohomish County cities and the county council.

### Pierce Transit

**[Pierce Transit](https://www.piercetransit.org/)** serves Tacoma and portions of Pierce County. Pierce Transit operates local bus service, the **Stream** community line (limited-stop service launched in 2024), and paratransit. Pierce Transit is governed by a board of commissioners appointed from Pierce County cities and the county council.

### Everett Transit

**[Everett Transit](https://www.everetttransit.org/)** is a city-operated bus system serving Everett and neighboring areas. It is the only municipal transit agency in the region and operates independently from Community Transit.

### Kitsap Transit

**[Kitsap Transit](https://www.kitsaptransit.com/)** serves Kitsap County with local bus service, paratransit, and the **Kitsap Fast Ferries** passenger-only ferry service to downtown Seattle. Kitsap Transit's fast ferries carried a record 854,529 passengers in 2024. See the **[Mass Transit]({{< relref "mass-transit" >}})** guide for ferry details.

### Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)

**[WSDOT](https://wsdot.wa.gov/)** owns and maintains state highways and the interstate system within the region, including I-5, I-90, I-405, SR 99 (including the downtown Seattle tunnel), SR 520, and SR 509. WSDOT also operates **[Washington State Ferries](https://wsdot.wa.gov/travel/washington-state-ferries)** (WSF), the largest ferry system in the United States, serving 20 terminals across 8 routes in Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. WSF carried 20.1 million passengers in 2025.

WSDOT's capital projects are funded by the state legislature through multi-year transportation packages. Recent packages include **Connecting Washington** (2015, $16 billion) and **Move Ahead Washington** (2022, $16.8 billion), which fund highway improvements, ferry electrification, and active transportation projects. The **Washington State Transportation Commission** serves as the state tolling authority, setting toll rates for SR 520, the SR 99 tunnel, and other tolled facilities. ([WSTC](https://wstc.wa.gov/))

WSDOT is a statutory member of PSRC and coordinates with cities and transit agencies on highway projects that affect local streets -- such as the SR 520 corridor reconstruction and the SR 509 completion project.

## How they coordinate

### ORCA fare system

The most visible form of inter-agency coordination is the **[ORCA](https://info.myorca.com/)** (One Regional Card for All) fare payment system, which allows riders to transfer seamlessly among 8 agencies: King County Metro, Sound Transit, Community Transit, Everett Transit, Pierce Transit, Kitsap Transit, Washington State Ferries, and the Seattle Center Monorail. ORCA represents a level of fare integration that most U.S. metropolitan areas lack. A next-generation ORCA system launched in 2022, and Google Wallet support was added in 2024. See the **[Mass Transit]({{< relref "mass-transit" >}})** guide for current fare details.

### Bus network restructures

As Sound Transit expands Link light rail, King County Metro, Community Transit, and other agencies restructure their bus networks to feed new stations rather than duplicate rail service. These restructures require extensive coordination between agencies:

- **Lynnwood Link** (2024): Community Transit restructured its entire network, eliminating downtown Seattle express service. Metro redesigned routes to feed Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, and Shoreline stations.
- **East Link** (2025-2026): Metro is creating 8 new routes, revising 16 routes, and deleting 20 routes to connect with 2 Line stations. ST Express Route 550 (Seattle-Bellevue) will be eliminated when the full cross-lake connection opens.
- **Federal Way Link** (2025-2026): Metro is restructuring south King County service to connect with Federal Way Link stations.

These restructures create ongoing tension between **frequency** (running fewer routes more often) and **coverage** (serving more areas less frequently). ([King County Metro East Link Connections](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/programs-and-projects/east-link-connections))

### PSRC project selection

All federally funded transportation projects in the region must be included in PSRC's **Regional Transportation Plan** and **Regional Transportation Improvement Program** (TIP). PSRC runs competitive grant rounds to allocate approximately $300 million per year in federal surface transportation funds from FHWA and FTA. Local agencies -- cities, counties, and transit operators -- apply for these funds, and PSRC's Transportation Policy Board evaluates and selects projects based on regional priorities. This process gives PSRC significant influence over which projects get built, even though it doesn't build anything itself. ([PSRC Transportation](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/transportation))

### Regional Transit Committee

The **[Regional Transit Committee](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/council/governance-leadership/county-council/committees/regional-transit-committee)** (RTC) provides a forum for King County cities and the county council to coordinate transit policy. With approximately 15 members -- including representatives from Seattle, suburban cities, and the county council -- the RTC reviews Metro's service guidelines, fare policies, and long-range plans before they go to the full King County Council for approval.

### Sound Transit and Metro coordination

Sound Transit and King County Metro operate on the same streets and serve many of the same stations, but they are separate agencies with separate budgets, boards, and planning processes. Coordination happens through:

- **Service integration:** Metro bus routes are designed to feed Link light rail stations, with coordinated schedules at major transfer points
- **Shared facilities:** Some transit centers and park-and-ride lots are jointly used
- **ORCA:** The shared fare system allows free transfers between agencies
- **Joint planning:** Both agencies participate in PSRC and coordinate on corridor-level planning

Despite these connections, the two-agency structure can lead to confusion for riders and duplication of administrative costs. The question of whether to merge Sound Transit and Metro -- or at least consolidate governance -- surfaces periodically in regional policy debates.

### WSDOT and local coordination

WSDOT coordinates with cities and transit agencies when highway projects affect local streets. Major examples include:

- **SR 520 corridor:** WSDOT's multi-billion-dollar reconstruction of SR 520 between I-5 and Lake Washington involves extensive coordination with Seattle on lid designs, bike and pedestrian connections, and transit access
- **Move Ahead Washington:** The 2022 state transportation package included dedicated active transportation and transit funding, requiring coordination between WSDOT and local agencies on project delivery
- **Amtrak Cascades:** WSDOT funds the Seattle-Portland and Seattle-Vancouver Amtrak Cascades service, coordinating with BNSF Railway on track access and with cities on station improvements

## Key decision-making processes

### How federal transportation funding flows

Federal transportation dollars follow a specific path to reach local projects:

1. **Congress** authorizes transportation spending through multi-year bills (currently the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act / Bipartisan Infrastructure Law)
2. **FHWA and FTA** distribute formula funds to states and metropolitan areas
3. **PSRC**, as the MPO, receives the region's allocation and runs competitive selection processes
4. **Local agencies** (cities, counties, transit operators) apply for and receive funds for specific projects
5. **PSRC boards** evaluate applications and select projects based on regional goals

This structure gives PSRC gatekeeping authority over federal dollars, making participation in PSRC's planning process important for any jurisdiction seeking federal transportation funds.

### How Sound Transit decides what to build

Sound Transit's capital program is defined by voter-approved ballot measures (ST1, ST2, ST3), which specify project lists and funding sources. The Board of Directors then makes implementation decisions:

1. **Voters** approve a package of projects and tax authority
2. **The Board** selects preferred alternatives for each project through environmental review
3. **Subarea equity** ensures each of the five geographic subareas receives investment proportional to its tax contribution
4. **The Board** approves final project designs, budgets, and construction contracts
5. **Realignment** adjusts timelines when costs change -- the Board adopted a [realignment plan](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/realignment) in 2021 after cost increases and revenue shortfalls

### How Metro decides where to run buses

King County Metro uses its **[Service Guidelines](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/about/policies)** to evaluate routes and allocate service. The guidelines balance productivity (ridership per hour), social equity (serving low-income and minority communities), and geographic coverage. When Metro adds or cuts service, the Regional Transit Committee reviews the proposal before it goes to the King County Council.

## Gaps and tensions

### Jurisdictional boundaries vs. travel patterns

People's travel patterns don't follow political boundaries. A commuter from Snohomish County to Seattle may use Community Transit, Sound Transit, and King County Metro in a single trip. Each agency has different governance, funding, and priorities, which can lead to service gaps at borders.

### Governance accountability

Sound Transit's board is made up of appointed elected officials, not directly elected transit commissioners. This means voters cannot directly elect or remove the people making decisions about the region's largest infrastructure investments. Proposals for a directly elected Sound Transit board have been debated in the legislature but not enacted.

### Uneven funding capacity

Subarea equity means wealthier areas generate more revenue and can afford more projects. South King County -- which has some of the region's highest-need transit riders -- generates less tax revenue per capita than East King County. The funding formula reflects where money is collected, not necessarily where transit need is greatest.

### PSRC's soft power

PSRC has significant influence through its control of federal funding allocation and regional growth targets, but it cannot compel cities to zone for growth. Cities that resist density can still receive federal transportation dollars. The gap between PSRC's regional vision and local implementation is a persistent tension in Puget Sound governance.
