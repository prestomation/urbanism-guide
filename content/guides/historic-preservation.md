# Historic Preservation & Landmarks in Seattle

Seattle protects more than 400 structures, sites, and objects of historic, cultural, architectural, and social significance as designated city landmarks. Eight historic districts cover neighborhoods from Pioneer Square to Sand Point. The city's preservation program, administered by the Department of Neighborhoods, works with property owners and community members to designate and protect places that connect Seattle to its past — while an ongoing debate over how preservation interacts with housing production shapes the program's future.

## Landmark districts

Seattle has eight designated historic districts, each governed by local ordinance. The appearance and historical integrity of structures and public spaces within each district are regulated by a citizens board and/or the [Landmarks Preservation Board](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation). Property owners must obtain a **Certificate of Approval** — a written authorization similar to a permit — before making exterior changes to buildings or structures within a district. ([Seattle Department of Neighborhoods](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts))

### Pioneer Square Preservation District (1970)

Seattle's first historic district. Pioneer Square marks the city's original downtown, settled in 1852 and rebuilt in fire-resistant brick and stone after the Great Fire of 1889. The district contains one of the nation's largest surviving collections of Romanesque Revival urban architecture. A grass-roots movement led by architects Ralph Anderson and Victor Steinbrueck defeated a 1960s urban renewal plan to demolish the area for parking garages. The City Council adopted the preservation ordinance in May 1970, and the district was simultaneously listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It currently spans approximately 88 acres. A dedicated **Pioneer Square Preservation Board** reviews changes through the Certificate of Approval process.

### Pike Place Market Historical District (1971)

On November 2, 1971, Seattle voters approved Initiative No. 1 by a three-to-two margin (76,369 to 53,264), establishing a seven-acre historic district to preserve Pike Place Market and prohibit alterations without commission approval. The effort was spearheaded by architect Victor Steinbrueck and the "Friends of the Market" campaign. A 12-member **Market Historical Commission** was created to preserve the Market's physical and social character. The district was expanded in 1986 to include Victor Steinbrueck Park and again in 1989. In 1973, the City created the **Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA)** to own and manage day-to-day operations. Over $50 million in public investment and $100 million in private money funded the subsequent ten-year restoration. ([Seattle City Archives: Pike Place Market Centennial](https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/online-exhibits/pike-place-market-centennial) | [HistoryLink](https://www.historylink.org/File/1426))

### International Special Review District (1973)

Established to preserve the unique Asian American character of the Chinatown-International District. The district covers approximately 23 acres near Pioneer Square and is home to about 7,000 residents speaking 17 different languages. In 1983, the **Seattle Chinatown National Register Historic District** was established within the Special Review District. The **International Special Review District Board** reviews proposed changes. ([Seattle.gov: International Special Review District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/international-special-review-district))

### Ballard Avenue Landmark District (1976)

The Landmarks Preservation Board designated the district on January 14, 1975, and the City Council created the district by ordinance on April 13, 1976. Ballard Avenue was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The district preserves a commercial streetscape from Ballard's early days as an independent city (annexed by Seattle in 1907) centered on the fishing and timber industries. ([Seattle.gov: Ballard Avenue](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/ballard-avenue-landmark-district))

### Columbia City Landmark District (1978)

Designated in 1978 to preserve the neighborhood's commercial core and encourage rehabilitation for community use, housing, and pedestrian-oriented businesses. Columbia City was listed as a National Register Historic District the same year. The neighborhood developed around the 1890s Columbia & Puget Sound Railroad and was annexed by Seattle in 1907. ([Seattle.gov: Columbia City](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/columbia-city-landmark-district))

### Harvard-Belmont Landmark District (1980)

A residential district on Capitol Hill initiated by neighborhood residents. The district preserves a collection of early 20th-century homes representing a range of architectural styles. ([Seattle.gov: Harvard-Belmont](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/harvard-belmont-landmark-district))

### Fort Lawton Landmark District (1988)

Preserves the best-surviving collection of early military buildings at Fort Lawton in Magnolia, which operated as a U.S. Army post from 1900 until the land was largely transferred to the city for Discovery Park in the 1970s. ([Seattle.gov: Fort Lawton](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/fort-lawton-landmark-district))

### Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District (2011)

Seattle's newest historic district. The Sand Point Naval Air Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 2010, and designated a Seattle landmark district on March 16, 2011. The district preserves buildings from the naval air station that operated at Sand Point from 1920 to 1970. ([Seattle.gov: Sand Point](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/sand-point-naval-air-station-landmark-district))

## Individual landmarks

Since 1973, Seattle has designated more than 450 individual sites, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and street clocks as city landmarks. All designated landmarks are codified in [Chapter 25.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.32LAPRDEAM) and approved by City Council ordinance. ([Seattle.gov: City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

Notable designated landmarks include the Space Needle, Gas Works Park, the Smith Tower, the Paramount Theatre, King Street Station, Mount Zion Baptist Church, and the Fremont Bridge. Mount Zion Baptist Church is one of only four Seattle landmarks to meet all six designation criteria — joining the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, and Climate Pledge Arena (formerly KeyArena). ([Seattle.gov: Landmarks List](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks/landmarks-list))

## How landmark designation works

The **Landmarks Preservation Board** manages the designation process under [SMC Chapter 25.12](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code/243570?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.12LAPR) (the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance). The board has 11 members with specified professional qualifications, plus one young adult position through the city's Get Engaged Program. Members are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. The board includes two architects, two historians, one structural engineer, and one representative each from urban planning, real estate, and finance, plus three at-large members. ([Wikipedia: Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Landmarks_Preservation_Board) | [Seattle.gov](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation))

### Designation criteria (SMC 25.12.350)

To be designated, a property must be at least 25 years old and meet at least one of six criteria:

1. **Criterion A:** Associated with a historic event with a significant effect on the community, city, state, or nation
2. **Criterion B:** Associated with the life of a person important in history
3. **Criterion C:** Associated with a significant aspect of cultural, political, or economic heritage
4. **Criterion D:** Embodies distinctive visible characteristics of an architectural style, period, or construction method
5. **Criterion E:** An outstanding work of a designer or builder
6. **Criterion F:** An easily identifiable visual feature of its neighborhood or the city due to prominence, spatial location, siting, age, or scale

The property must also possess integrity — the ability to convey its significance. ([Seattle.gov: City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

### Four-step process

1. **Nomination:** Any person or group may submit a nomination to the Landmarks Preservation Board
2. **Designation:** The board holds public hearings, reviews staff reports, and votes on whether the property meets designation criteria
3. **Controls and incentives:** The board negotiates an agreement with the property owner specifying which features are protected and what incentives (such as Special Tax Valuation) apply
4. **Designating ordinance:** The agreement is forwarded to the City Council for adoption as an ordinance

([Seattle.gov: City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

## Preservation incentives

### Special Tax Valuation

Washington's Special Valuation of Property Act ([RCW 84.26](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.26)) allows designated landmark owners to subtract approved rehabilitation costs from their property's assessed value for up to 10 years, reducing property taxes during that period. Eligible properties must undergo rehabilitation costing at least 25% of the assessed improvement value. The Landmarks Preservation Board serves as the local review board. ([Seattle.gov: Preservation Incentives](https://seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives))

### Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit

Income-producing properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are eligible for a 20% federal income tax credit against qualified rehabilitation expenses. ([Seattle.gov: Preservation Incentives](https://seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives))

### Building code relief

The Seattle Building Code allows the Director of [SDCI]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#sdci-seattle-department-of-construction-and-inspections" >}}) to modify specific building code requirements for landmark buildings, recognizing that strict modern code compliance may be impractical or destructive to historic fabric. ([Seattle.gov: Preservation Incentives](https://seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives))

## History

### 1970: Pioneer Square becomes Seattle's first preservation district

A grass-roots movement defeated an urban renewal plan to demolish Pioneer Square for parking garages. The City Council designated 20 square blocks as Seattle's first historic district in May 1970, following a petition with 100,000 signatures. The district was simultaneously listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ([Seattle.gov: Pioneer Square](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pioneer-square-preservation-district))

### 1971: Voters save Pike Place Market

Seattle voters approved Initiative No. 1, establishing the Pike Place Market Historical District and creating the Market Historical Commission to oversee preservation. The vote ended an eight-year controversy over plans to demolish and redevelop the Market. ([HistoryLink](https://www.historylink.org/File/1426))

### 1973: Landmarks Preservation Ordinance adopted

The City Council passed the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance (SMC 25.12), creating the Landmarks Preservation Board and establishing the designation process still in use. The International Special Review District was also established the same year. ([Seattle.gov: Historic Preservation](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation))

### 1976–1988: Additional districts designated

The city designated five more landmark districts over 12 years: Ballard Avenue (1976), Columbia City (1978), Harvard-Belmont (1980), and Fort Lawton (1988), each preserving a distinct neighborhood character. ([Seattle.gov: Historic Districts](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts))

### 2011: Sand Point becomes eighth district

The Sand Point Naval Air Station was designated Seattle's eighth and newest landmark district, preserving buildings from the naval air station that operated from 1920 to 1970. ([Seattle.gov: Sand Point](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/sand-point-naval-air-station-landmark-district))

### 2023–2025: Preservation and housing tension escalates

Washington's [HB 1110]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#hb-1110" >}}) (2023) required cities to allow middle housing across residential areas, but the landmark nomination process created a potential conflict. Under Seattle's current rules, any person can nominate a property for landmark status — and the nomination process can delay or block permitted development projects. In late 2024, a fully permitted 49-unit mixed-income apartment project in the Central District was halted after an eleventh-hour landmark nomination of the existing structure. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/))

Past cases illustrate the pattern: a 2016 landmark designation of the Mama's Mexican Kitchen building in Belltown blocked 63 planned apartments; the building sat derelict until it was demolished. The 2015 landmarking of the Wayne Apartments blocked 124 apartments; the building deteriorated, caught fire in 2022, and was then demolished. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/))

In the 2025 legislative session, Representative Amy Walen and Senator Jesse Salomon introduced HB 1576 / SB 5554 to require owner consent for landmark designation statewide — aligning Seattle with the three-quarters of Washington cities that already require owner consent. The bills would exempt existing locally designated historic districts and prohibit landmarking structures less than 40 years old. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/))

## Preservation vs. density

The tension between historic preservation and housing production is one of Seattle's most active policy debates. Key dimensions include:

**Landmark nominations as a development barrier.** Because any person can nominate a property for landmark status in Seattle, the process can be used strategically to delay or prevent housing construction — even for fully permitted projects. Small-scale builders planning middle housing under HB 1110 are particularly vulnerable, as they lack the financial resources to absorb the risk of an unexpected landmark nomination. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/) | [Sightline Institute](https://www.sightline.org/2017/12/19/when-historic-preservation-clashes-with-housing-affordability/))

**Historic district expansion proposals.** Some neighborhood groups have sought to create new historic districts as a way to limit the density increases required by HB 1110 and the [One Seattle Plan]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#comprehensive-plan" >}}). Preservation advocates argue that preservation and housing are not mutually exclusive and that historic buildings can be reused for affordable housing. Housing advocates counter that restricting development in established neighborhoods displaces growth pressure to other areas and raises costs. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/))

**Unreinforced masonry buildings.** Many of Seattle's approximately 1,100 identified [unreinforced masonry (URM)]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#unreinforced-masonry-urm" >}}) buildings are also historic landmarks or located within landmark districts, particularly in Pioneer Square and the Chinatown-International District. The city's mandatory seismic retrofit program (adopted 2024) intersects with preservation requirements, as retrofit work must be reviewed by the Landmarks Preservation Board or district boards. ([Seattle SDCI: URM Buildings](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings))

## State and federal preservation programs

### Washington DAHP

The **Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP)** is the state agency that administers three registers: the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington Heritage Register, and the Heritage Barn Register. Over 10,300 properties represented by more than 2,400 listings have been added across all three. Unlike Seattle's city landmark program, listing on state and federal registers requires owner consent and offers no legal protection against alteration or demolition by private owners using their own funds. However, projects involving federal or state agency actions receive DAHP review under **Section 106** of the National Historic Preservation Act to identify preservation opportunities. ([DAHP: Historic Registers](https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-registers))

### National Register of Historic Places

Washington has more than 1,500 National Register listings out of over 90,000 nationwide. Properties must generally be at least 50 years old and retain their historic character. Several Seattle historic districts are also listed on the National Register, including Pioneer Square (1970), Ballard Avenue (1976), and Columbia City (1978). The DAHP WISAARD database provides public access to all inventoried historic properties. ([DAHP: National Register](https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-registers/national-register-of-historic-places) | [DAHP: Find a Historic Place](https://dahp.wa.gov/find-a-historic-place))
