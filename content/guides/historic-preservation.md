# Historic Preservation & Landmarks in Seattle

Seattle has designated more than 400 individual landmarks and eight historic districts since adopting its **Landmarks Preservation Ordinance** (SMC 25.12) in 1973. The program protects buildings, sites, and objects of historic significance — but it also intersects with the city's housing goals, seismic safety needs, and development pressures. This guide covers Seattle's preservation system, its historic districts, the landmark designation process, and the ongoing tension between preservation and density.

## Seattle's eight historic districts

Since 1970, Seattle has established eight historic districts. Each district regulates exterior changes through a citizen review board or the **Landmarks Preservation Board**, and property owners must obtain a **Certificate of Approval** before modifying designated features. ([Seattle Historic Districts](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts))

### Pioneer Square Preservation District

Seattle's first preservation district, established in 1970 and covering approximately 88 acres of the city's original downtown. The neighborhood was rebuilt in brick and stone after the [Great Fire of 1889](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire) and contains one of the nation's best-preserved collections of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. By the 1960s, a city plan would have razed many buildings for a highway ring road. Architect Victor Steinbrueck and others led a grassroots preservation campaign that resulted in the 1970 designation. The district is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ([Pioneer Square Preservation District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pioneer-square-preservation-district))

### Pike Place Market Historical District

Voters approved the Pike Place Market preservation initiative on November 2, 1971, by a 3-to-2 margin, after the "Friends of the Market" campaign led by architect Victor Steinbrueck fought an urban renewal plan that would have demolished much of the market. The **Pike Place Market Historical Commission**, 12 citizen volunteers appointed by the Mayor, oversees the district. The market first opened on August 17, 1907, and the **Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority** (PDA), created in 1973, manages publicly owned buildings in the district. ([Pike Place Market Historical District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pike-place-market-historical-district))

### International Special Review District

Established in 1973 to "preserve and perpetuate the cultural, economic, historical, and otherwise beneficial qualities of the area, particularly the features derived from its Asian heritage." The **ISRD Board** has seven members — five elected by the Chinatown-International District community and two appointed by the Mayor. The district developed on reclaimed tide flats after early 20th-century regrading and is the only area in the continental United States where Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Vietnamese communities historically settled together. Interstate 5 construction in the 1960s and Kingdome construction in the 1970s displaced residents and businesses. In 2023, the **National Trust for Historic Preservation** named the Chinatown-International District to its [11 Most Endangered Historic Places](https://savingplaces.org/stories/11-most-endangered-historic-places-2023) list — the first Washington State site ever included. ([International Special Review District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/international-special-review-district))

### Ballard Avenue Landmark District

Designated by the Landmarks Preservation Board in 1975 and created by City Council ordinance in 1976. The district preserves Ballard's central business district from the 1890s through the 1940s, with original granite curbs and commercial buildings reflecting the neighborhood's origins as a lumber and fishing hub. Captain William Ballard formed the West Coast Improvement Company in 1887; Ballard Avenue's role as the main arterial was later supplanted by Market Street, which effectively froze commercial development and preserved the streetscape. ([Ballard Avenue Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/ballard-avenue-landmark-district))

### Columbia City Landmark District

Designated in 1978 and also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Columbia City was an independent city (incorporated 1893) that prospered from logging and the Seattle, Renton, and Southern Railway before being annexed by Seattle in 1907. ([Columbia City Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/columbia-city-landmark-district))

### Harvard-Belmont Landmark District

Designated in 1980. Located on the west slope of Capitol Hill above I-5, the district contains a well-preserved residential neighborhood of early 20th-century homes built by financiers, industrialists, and merchants, with tree-lined streets and views toward Lake Union. ([Harvard-Belmont Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/harvard-belmont-landmark-district))

### Fort Lawton Landmark District

Designated in 1988. Located on Magnolia Bluff within Discovery Park, the district contains the best-preserved collection of early Fort Lawton military buildings from the Army post established in 1900. ([Fort Lawton Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/fort-lawton-landmark-district))

### Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District

Designated in 2011. The 89-acre district next to Lake Washington preserves buildings from the naval air station where ground was broken in 1920. The site served as the start and end point of the first aerial circumnavigation of the globe in 1924 and peaked at over 4,600 personnel during World War II. The area is now adjacent to Magnuson Park and the NOAA Western Regional Center. ([Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/sand-point-naval-air-station-landmark-district))

## Landmark designation process

The **Landmarks Preservation Board**, established by SMC 25.12 and housed within the **Department of Neighborhoods**, is responsible for designating and protecting landmarks. The board is appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council and includes architects, historians, a structural engineer, and representatives from finance and real estate. ([City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

Designation follows a four-step process ([Certificate of Approval](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/certificate-of-approval)):

1. **Nomination** — Any person or organization can nominate a property at least 25 years old. The City Historic Preservation Officer reviews the application for completeness.
2. **Designation** — The board holds a public meeting 30–60 days after nomination and votes on whether the property meets at least one of six criteria under [SMC 25.12.350](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.12LAPR), including association with a significant event, notable person, or architectural style.
3. **Controls and incentives** — Staff negotiate a Controls and Incentives Agreement with the property owner, defining which features are protected and what benefits apply.
4. **Designating ordinance** — The agreement goes to City Council for approval.

Once designated, any changes to protected features require a **Certificate of Approval** from the Landmarks Board or the relevant district board. ([Certificate of Approval](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/certificate-of-approval))

## History

### 1970: Pioneer Square becomes Seattle's first preservation district

A grassroots campaign led by architect Victor Steinbrueck and others defeated plans for a highway ring road through the neighborhood. The City Council designated Pioneer Square as Seattle's first historic district, which also earned a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. ([Pioneer Square Preservation District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pioneer-square-preservation-district))

### 1971: Voters save Pike Place Market

Citizens approved a ballot initiative to preserve Pike Place Market, rejecting an urban renewal plan backed by the city establishment. The vote created the Pike Place Market Historical District and led to the formation of the Market PDA in 1973 to manage publicly owned properties. ([Pike Place Market Historical District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pike-place-market-historical-district))

### 1973: Landmarks Preservation Ordinance adopted

The City Council adopted SMC Chapter 25.12, establishing the Landmarks Preservation Board, the designation process, the six landmark criteria, and the Certificate of Approval system. The same year, the International Special Review District was created. ([SMC 25.12](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.12LAPR))

### 2000: Historic Resources Survey begins

The Department of Neighborhoods launched a systematic survey of historic resources across Seattle, using professional architectural historians and volunteers. The survey has documented over 5,000 properties across multiple neighborhoods, creating a searchable public database. Listing in the survey does not restrict property use — only formal landmark designation carries regulatory weight. ([Historic Resources Survey](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-resources-survey))

### 2023: Chinatown-International District named nationally endangered

The **National Trust for Historic Preservation** placed the Chinatown-International District on its 11 Most Endangered Historic Places list, citing threats from development pressures, infrastructure projects, and social challenges. It was the first Washington State site to appear on the list since its creation in 1988. ([National Trust](https://savingplaces.org/stories/11-most-endangered-historic-places-2023))

### 2025: State legislature advances landmark reform

The Washington Legislature advanced **SB 5554 / HB 1576**, which passed the Senate 47–2 in April 2025. The bill requires **owner consent** for landmark designation of properties under 125 years old, raises the minimum age for nomination from 25 to 40 years, and exempts properties already in a historic district or over 125 years old. Proponents argued the bill prevents abuse of the landmark process to block housing; opponents, including the **Washington Trust for Historic Preservation**, argued it would weaken protections for significant mid-century buildings. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/) | [Sightline](https://www.sightline.org/2017/12/19/when-historic-preservation-clashes-with-housing-affordability/))

## Preservation vs. density

Seattle's landmark program allows any person to nominate any building over 25 years old for landmark status without the owner's consent. This has produced well-documented cases where landmark nominations blocked or delayed housing development:

- **Wayne Apartments** — A 124-unit development was blocked by a 2015 landmark designation. The building deteriorated and was damaged by fire in 2022.
- **Mama's Mexican Kitchen** — A 2016 preemptive landmark nomination blocked a 63-unit apartment project. The building became derelict and was demolished in January 2025.
- **Pioneer Square parking garage** — A proposed 200-unit apartment building was rejected because it exceeded the height of nearby historic buildings, even though zoning permitted the height. The site remained a surface parking lot.

The **Sightline Institute** has argued that the ability to nominate buildings without owner consent creates financial uncertainty that discourages small-scale housing development, particularly the [missing middle housing]({{< relref "/glossary/housing-zoning#missing-middle-housing" >}}) that **HB 1110** (2023) legalized statewide. Sightline has proposed a "no net loss of homes" framework: when a preservation ruling causes housing not to be built, offsetting zoning changes elsewhere in the neighborhood would be required to allow equivalent new construction. ([Sightline](https://www.sightline.org/2017/12/19/when-historic-preservation-clashes-with-housing-affordability/) | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/02/19/washington-legislature-wants-to-rein-in-historic-landmarking/))

The **One Seattle Comprehensive Plan**, adopted in December 2025, must accommodate 80,000 new housing units and 159,000 new jobs by 2044. The plan makes space for approximately 120,000 units and 158,000 jobs. Landmark designations that remove sites from the developable supply directly affect these targets. ([Seattle OPCD](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan))

## Preservation incentives

Seattle offers multiple incentives for landmark property owners to offset the costs of maintaining historic buildings ([Preservation Incentives](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives)):

**Local incentives:**
- **Transfer of Development Rights (TDR):** Owners of landmarks in downtown zones can sell unused development capacity to other sites. The city operates a TDR bank.
- **Special Tax Valuation:** Subtracts approved rehabilitation costs from assessed property value for up to 10 years. Rehabilitation costs must equal or exceed 25% of the assessed improvement value.
- **Zoning code relief:** Administrative conditional uses allow otherwise non-permitted uses in landmark buildings; waivers of open space, setback, and parking requirements may also be granted.
- **Building code modifications:** The SDCI Director may modify building code requirements for designated landmarks.

**Federal incentives:**
- **20% Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit** for National Register properties in commercial, industrial, or rental residential use
- **Preservation easements:** Tax deduction for donating a facade easement to a nonprofit

**State incentives:**
- **Special tax valuation** under RCW 84.26: reduced property tax assessment for qualifying properties

## How the city manages historic preservation

### Administrative structure

The **Historic Preservation Program** within the **Department of Neighborhoods** administers all preservation functions. It staffs the Landmarks Preservation Board and the boards for all eight historic districts, processes nominations and Certificate of Approval applications, and employs the City Historic Preservation Officer. The program also administers the **Historic Resources Survey**, which has documented over 5,000 properties since 2000. ([Department of Neighborhoods](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation))

### Regulatory framework

- **SMC 25.12** — The Landmarks Preservation Ordinance governs individual landmark designation
- **SMC 23.66** — Regulates the International Special Review District
- **SMC 25.24** — Governs the Pike Place Market Historical Commission
- **National Register of Historic Places** — Federal listing administered at the state level by the **Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation** (DAHP). Properties must generally be at least 50 years old. ([DAHP](https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-registers/national-register-of-historic-places))
- **Washington Heritage Register** — A state-level register administered by DAHP with a faster recognition process than the National Register ([DAHP](https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-registers/washington-heritage-register))

### Connection to seismic safety

Seattle has approximately 1,100 identified [unreinforced masonry (URM)]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#unreinforced-masonry-urm" >}}) buildings, many concentrated in Pioneer Square and the Chinatown-International District. These are the most dangerous building type in earthquakes. The city adopted a voluntary URM retrofit code in November 2024 and is planning a mandatory retrofit ordinance. The cost of seismic retrofits ($45–$155 per square foot) creates significant financial pressure on owners of historic buildings, particularly those with affordable housing and small businesses. ([SDCI URM Program](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings))

## Advocacy organizations

- **[Historic Seattle](https://historicseattle.org/):** Founded in 1974, the only nonprofit membership organization dedicated to preserving Seattle and King County's architectural legacy. Operates the Preservation Action Fund (a revolving fund for acquiring, landmarking, and rehabilitating at-risk properties), holds preservation easements, and advocates for landmark policies.
- **[Washington Trust for Historic Preservation](https://preservewa.org/):** Founded in 1976, Washington's only statewide nonprofit preservation advocacy organization. Headquartered at the Stimson-Green Mansion in Seattle. Publishes the Most Endangered Places list (since 1992), administers the Valerie Sivinski Fund for preservation grants, and lobbies on state and federal preservation policy.
- **[4Culture](https://www.4culture.org/preservation/):** King County's cultural funding agency. Preservation programs include the Preservation Special Projects grants, Preservation Action Fund (in partnership with Historic Seattle), landmark nomination support, and an equity in historic preservation internship focused on properties significant to underrepresented communities.
- **[Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP)](https://dahp.wa.gov/):** Washington State agency administering the National Register of Historic Places and Washington Heritage Register in Washington. Maintains the WISAARD database, the statewide historic property inventory.
- **[Sightline Institute](https://www.sightline.org/):** Pacific Northwest policy think tank that has advocated for landmark reform from a pro-housing perspective, documenting cases where preservation blocked housing development.
