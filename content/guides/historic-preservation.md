# Historic Preservation & Landmarks in Seattle

Seattle's historic preservation program protects over 400 individually designated landmarks and eight historic districts. Administered by the [Landmarks Preservation Board](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation) within the Department of Neighborhoods, the program regulates changes to designated properties and districts through a Certificate of Approval process. In recent years, historic preservation has become one of the city's most contentious policy areas as landmark designations intersect with the push to build more housing.

## Historic districts

Since 1970, Seattle has established eight historic districts. Each district has its own review board or committee that evaluates proposed changes to buildings and public spaces within the district boundaries.

### Pioneer Square Preservation District (1970)

Seattle's first preservation district covers approximately 88 acres of the city's original downtown, rebuilt after the [Great Fire of 1889](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seattle_Fire). The district contains one of the nation's best surviving collections of Romanesque Revival urban architecture. In the 1960s, a city plan proposed building a ring road that would have demolished many of these buildings. Architect Ralph Anderson and planner Victor Steinbrueck led a grassroots campaign that resulted in designation as both a local and national historic district in 1970. ([Seattle.gov: Pioneer Square Preservation District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pioneer-square-preservation-district))

### Pike Place Market Historical District (1971)

Voters approved an initiative in 1971 to preserve Pike Place Market, which had been threatened by an urban renewal plan that would have demolished most of the market's buildings and replaced them with hotels and parking garages. The district protects the market's physical structure, use mix, and character as a public market — unlike most districts, interior changes also require approval. The Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) manages the market's publicly owned properties. ([Seattle.gov: Pike Place Market Historical District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/pike-place-market-historical-district))

### International Special Review District (1973)

The International Special Review District covers the Chinatown-International District (CID), the historic center of Seattle's Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Many buildings date from 1905–1910 following neighborhood regrading. The district was established to protect the neighborhood's cultural identity and architectural character during a period of displacement pressure from the construction of the Kingdome and I-5. ([Seattle.gov: International Special Review District](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts/international-special-review-district))

### Other districts

- **Ballard Avenue Landmark District (1976):** A commercial corridor in the former City of Ballard, annexed by Seattle in 1907, with turn-of-the-century brick storefronts tied to the neighborhood's Scandinavian fishing and timber heritage.
- **Columbia City Landmark District (1978):** The historic business district of Columbia City, a former independent town annexed in 1907, centered on Rainier Avenue S.
- **Harvard-Belmont Landmark District (1979):** A residential district on Capitol Hill containing early 20th-century homes in a range of architectural styles.
- **Fort Lawton Landmark District (2011):** The former U.S. Army post in Magnolia, now largely incorporated into Discovery Park. Includes officers' quarters, barracks, and other military structures dating to 1900.
- **Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District (2011):** A former naval air station on the shores of Lake Washington, now part of Magnuson Park. Includes hangars, housing, and administrative buildings from the World War II era.

([Seattle.gov: Historic Districts](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts))

## Individual landmarks

Outside the historic districts, Seattle has designated over 400 individual properties as city landmarks since 1973. Designated landmarks range from the Space Needle and Smith Tower to residential homes, boats, vehicles, and cast-iron street clocks. A property must be at least 25 years old to be eligible for designation. ([Seattle.gov: City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

### Designation process

Any person or group can nominate a property for landmark status. The nomination goes to the Landmarks Preservation Board, which holds a public hearing and evaluates the property against six criteria covering historical, architectural, cultural, and social significance. If the board votes to designate, it negotiates controls and incentives with the property owner, and the Seattle City Council adopts a designating ordinance. ([Seattle.gov: City Landmarks](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/city-landmarks))

### Certificate of Approval

Any change to a designated landmark or to the exterior of any building within a historic district requires a **Certificate of Approval** from the Landmarks Preservation Board or the relevant district board. This includes alterations, demolition, new construction, and signage changes. In the Pike Place Market district, interior changes also require approval. ([Seattle.gov: Certificate of Approval](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/certificate-of-approval))

## History

### 1966: National Historic Preservation Act

The federal government passed the [National Historic Preservation Act](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservation/national-historic-preservation-act.htm), creating the National Register of Historic Places and establishing the framework for state and local preservation programs. This spurred preservation activity in Seattle.

### 1970–1971: Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market saved

In response to demolition threats, Seattle designated its first two historic districts. Pioneer Square was designated in 1970 after a citizen campaign led by architect Ralph Anderson and planner Victor Steinbrueck. The following year, Seattle voters approved Initiative 1 to preserve Pike Place Market, rejecting an urban renewal plan. These were among the first National Register districts in the nation. ([Seattle.gov: Historic Districts](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/historic-districts))

### 1973: Landmarks Preservation Ordinance

The Seattle City Council adopted the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance (SMC 25.12), creating the Landmarks Preservation Board and establishing the city's framework for designating and protecting individual landmarks and historic districts. The board's composition is specified by ordinance: at least two architects, two historians, one City Planning Commission member, one structural engineer, and one representative each from finance and real estate management. ([Seattle Municipal Code 25.12](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.12LAPR))

### 1985: Special Tax Valuation enacted

The Washington State Legislature passed a law allowing "special valuation" for historic properties, providing a 10-year property tax reduction for owners who invest in approved rehabilitations. The Landmarks Preservation Board serves as the local review board for Seattle properties. ([Seattle.gov: Preservation Incentives](https://seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives))

### 2000: Citywide historic resources survey

Seattle began a systematic survey of historic resources. Professional architectural historians and volunteers have inventoried more than 8,500 properties throughout the city, creating a baseline for understanding the city's built heritage. ([Seattle.gov: Historic Preservation](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation))

### 2025: HB 1576 — Owner consent required for landmarking

Governor Inslee signed Substitute House Bill 1576 (Chapter 241, 2025 Laws), effective July 27, 2025. The law prohibits cities from designating a property as a landmark outside an existing historic district without the written consent of the property owner if the property is less than 100 years old and the designation would restrict use. Existing designations are unaffected. The bill passed the House 95-0 and the Senate 47-2. ([SHB 1576 Final Bill Report](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1576-S%20HBR%20FBR%2025.pdf))

## Preservation and density: the central tension

Historic preservation and housing production are increasingly in conflict in Seattle. Fewer than 0.5% of Seattle's parcels are designated landmarks (individually or in districts), but high-profile cases have drawn attention to how landmark nominations can block housing development. ([Washington Trust for Historic Preservation](https://preservewa.org/advocacy-alert-hb-1576-sb-5554-updates/))

Key flashpoints include:

- **Wayne Apartments:** The Landmarks Preservation Board designated the dilapidated Wayne Apartments building, halting plans for a 124-unit apartment building on the site. ([Sightline Institute](https://www.sightline.org/2017/12/19/when-historic-preservation-clashes-with-housing-affordability/))
- **Central District 49-unit project (2024):** A fully permitted mixed-income apartment project was halted by an eleventh-hour landmark nomination of an existing structure on the site. ([Cascade PBS](https://www.cascadepbs.org/news/2025/03/whats-happening-seattles-housing-density-plan/))
- **Doyle Building (2025):** A proposal to add 12 stories of mass-timber housing above a landmarked downtown building faced resistance at the Landmarks Preservation Board, illustrating the challenge of adding density to historic structures. ([The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/08/07/downtown-mass-timber-tower-project-meets-resistance-at-seattle-landmark-board/))

Preservation advocates argue that historic buildings provide naturally occurring affordable space, contribute to neighborhood character, and can be adaptively reused. Housing advocates counter that landmark nominations without owner consent have been used to block housing on sites where the state's middle housing law (HB 1110) now permits duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes, and that small builders lack the resources to absorb the risk of a potential landmark designation. HB 1576's owner-consent requirement was the legislature's response to this tension.

## How the city manages historic preservation

### Administering agency

The Historic Preservation Program within the **Department of Neighborhoods** administers the city's preservation activities, staffed by the City Historic Preservation Officer. The program processes landmark nominations, manages the Certificate of Approval process, maintains the landmarks inventory, and staffs the Landmarks Preservation Board and district review committees. ([Seattle.gov: Historic Preservation](https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation))

### Preservation incentives

Seattle offers several incentives to offset the costs of maintaining landmark properties:

| Incentive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Special Tax Valuation** | 10-year property tax reduction for approved rehabilitations exceeding 25% of assessed improvement value |
| **Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)** | Owners of downtown landmarks can sell unused development rights to other properties |
| **Federal Historic Tax Credit** | 20% income tax credit on qualified rehabilitation costs for income-producing National Register properties |
| **Zoning code relief** | SDCI may authorize uses not normally permitted in a zone for designated landmarks |
| **Building code relief** | SDCI may modify specific building code requirements for landmark buildings |
| **4Culture Landmarks Capital Grants** | Up to $100,000 for rehabilitation of designated landmarks in King County |

([Seattle.gov: Preservation Incentives](https://seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives) | [4Culture: Landmarks Capital](https://www.4culture.org/grants/landmarks-capital/))

### Registers and overlapping designations

A property in Seattle can be listed on multiple registers simultaneously:

- **Seattle Landmarks** — Designated by the Landmarks Preservation Board under SMC 25.12
- **Washington Heritage Register** — Maintained by the Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP)
- **National Register of Historic Places** — Federal designation administered by the National Park Service

National Register listing does not impose local regulatory controls on its own; only city landmark designation triggers the Certificate of Approval requirement. However, National Register listing is required for the federal historic tax credit. ([Historic Seattle: Landmarks and Registers](https://historicseattle.org/advocacy/landmarks-historic-registers/))
