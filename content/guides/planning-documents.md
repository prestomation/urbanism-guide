# How to Read a Planning Document in Seattle

Seattle produces thousands of planning documents every year — comprehensive plans, environmental impact statements, SEPA checklists, design review packets, and permit applications. These documents shape what gets built, where growth goes, and how public money is spent. This guide explains the main document types, where to find them, what to look for, and how to participate effectively in public comment.

## Types of planning documents

### Comprehensive plan

The **One Seattle Plan** is Seattle's comprehensive plan, a 20-year vision and roadmap that guides decisions on housing, transportation, land use, capital investments, and infrastructure. Washington's [Growth Management Act]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#gma-growth-management-act" >}}) requires every city to maintain and periodically update a comprehensive plan. The current plan was adopted by City Council on December 16, 2025, and took effect January 21, 2026. ([Seattle OPCD: One Seattle Plan](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan))

**How it's organized.** The plan is divided into thematic **elements** — growth strategy, land use, housing, transportation, utilities, capital facilities, community, and neighborhoods. Each element contains **goals** (aspirational outcomes the city hopes to achieve over 20 years) and **policies** (general guidance that shapes future rules, budgets, and programs). Read each policy as if it begins with "It is the City's general policy to..." Some elements also include appendices with supporting data and analysis. ([One Seattle Plan Citywide Policies (PDF)](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/OPCD/SeattlePlan/OneSeattlePlanCitywidePoliciesUpdate.pdf))

**What to look for:**

- **Growth strategy maps** — These show where density is directed: Regional Centers, Urban Centers, Neighborhood Centers, and corridors. Compare your neighborhood's current zoning to the proposed changes using the [One Seattle Plan Zoning Map](https://one-seattle-plan-zoning-implementation-seattlecitygis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zoning-map).
- **Policy language changes** — OPCD publishes crosswalk tables showing current policies alongside proposed new language. Read these to spot where the city is strengthening, weakening, or eliminating a commitment.
- **The Racial Equity Toolkit and Anti-Displacement Framework** — These supplemental documents explain how equity considerations shaped the plan's growth strategy. ([OPCD Project Documents](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan/project-documents))

### SEPA checklist

A **SEPA environmental checklist** is a standardized questionnaire that applicants fill out when proposing a project that may affect the environment. The checklist covers earth/geology, air quality, water, plants, animals, energy, noise, land use, housing, transportation, and public services. It is the starting point for all [SEPA]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#sepa-state-environmental-policy-act" >}}) environmental review in Seattle. ([WA Ecology: SEPA Overview](https://ecology.wa.gov/regulations-permits/sepa/environmental-review/sepa-guidance/basic-overview))

**What to look for:**

- **Section B (Environmental Elements)** — This is the substance of the checklist. Each subsection asks the applicant to describe existing conditions and potential impacts. Pay attention to answers about traffic generation, stormwater, tree removal, and shadow impacts.
- **Mitigating measures** — Applicants may list conditions they'll accept to reduce impacts. These can become binding if the city issues a Mitigated Determination of Non-Significance (MDNS).
- **What's missing** — Checklists are self-reported by applicants. Look for vague or incomplete answers, especially on topics like transportation impacts or displacement.

### Environmental impact statement (EIS)

An **[EIS]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#eis-environmental-impact-statement" >}})** is a detailed study required when a project or plan is likely to have significant environmental impacts. In Seattle, EIS documents have been prepared for major actions including the One Seattle Plan comprehensive plan update, the Seattle Transportation Plan, Sound Transit light rail extensions, and large development projects. ([MRSC: State Environmental Policy Act](https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/environment/regulations/state-environmental-policy-act))

An EIS typically runs hundreds of pages. Here is how to navigate one efficiently:

**Key sections to read:**

| Section | What it contains | Why it matters |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Executive summary | Condensed overview of findings | Start here to understand the scope and key conclusions |
| Purpose and need | Why the action is being proposed | Reveals the framing that shapes the entire analysis |
| Alternatives | Different options analyzed (including "no action") | The heart of the EIS — compare trade-offs between alternatives |
| Affected environment | Baseline conditions in the project area | Establishes what exists today before the proposed changes |
| Environmental consequences | Predicted impacts of each alternative | The most technical section — focus on topics you care about (traffic, housing, noise, etc.) |
| Mitigation measures | Actions proposed to reduce impacts | These often become binding conditions on the project |
| Response to comments | Agency responses to public input on the draft EIS | Shows how (or whether) the agency addressed community concerns |

**How the process works:**

1. The lead agency issues a **Determination of Significance (DS)**, announcing that an EIS is required.
2. A **scoping** period allows the public to identify issues the EIS should address.
3. A **Draft EIS** is published for public review and comment (minimum 30 days for state SEPA actions).
4. The agency publishes a **Final EIS** incorporating responses to comments.
5. A waiting period follows before the final decision is made.

**Tips for reading an EIS:**

- Start with the executive summary and the alternatives comparison table.
- Focus on the topics most relevant to your concerns (e.g., transportation, displacement, noise).
- Read the "no action" alternative to understand what happens if the proposal doesn't move forward.
- Check whether the alternatives represent genuinely different approaches or minor variations.
- Look at the response to comments section to see whether the agency meaningfully addressed public input.

### SEPA threshold determinations

After reviewing a SEPA checklist, SDCI issues one of three threshold determinations:

- **Determination of Non-Significance (DNS):** The project is unlikely to have significant environmental impacts. No EIS is required. The public has 14 days to comment and 14 days to appeal to the [Hearing Examiner](https://www.seattle.gov/hearing-examiner).
- **Mitigated Determination of Non-Significance (MDNS):** The project could have significant impacts, but the applicant has agreed to conditions that reduce them. Same comment and appeal timeline as a DNS.
- **Determination of Significance (DS):** Significant impacts are likely. An EIS must be prepared before the project can proceed.

([Seattle SDCI: SEPA Permits](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/permits-we-issue-(a-z)/land-use--master-use-permit---state-environmental-policy-act-(sepa)))

**Recent change:** As of July 2023, the state legislature exempted most residential and mixed-use housing projects from SEPA review to help accelerate housing production. Projects proposing additional housing units — including infill development in urban centers — are now generally categorically exempt.

### Master use permit (MUP)

A **[Master Use Permit]({{< relref "/glossary/land-use#mup-master-use-permit" >}})** is Seattle's combined land use permit that bundles zoning approvals, environmental review, and design review into a single application. Most new construction and major alterations require a MUP. ([Seattle SDCI: Land Use Division](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/land-use))

**What to look for in a MUP application:**

- **Project description** — What is being built, how many units, what height and bulk.
- **Zoning compliance** — Whether the project meets current zoning requirements or is requesting departures.
- **SEPA determination** — The environmental review decision attached to the permit.
- **Public notice sign** — A large sign posted at the project site with the project number, description, and instructions for commenting.

**How to find MUP decisions:** SDCI publishes land use decisions through the [Seattle Services Portal](https://services.seattle.gov/). Search by address or project number to find application details, project documents, and decision letters.

### Design review packets

**Design review** is Seattle's process for shaping the appearance and street-level experience of new multifamily and commercial buildings. Projects go through one of three tracks: ([Seattle SDCI: Design Review](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/design-review))

- **Full Design Review** — For larger projects. Requires public [Design Review Board](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/design-review/virtual-board-meetings) meetings at the Early Design Guidance (EDG) phase and the Recommendation phase.
- **Administrative Design Review** — Staff-level review for smaller projects, without board meetings.
- **Streamlined Design Review** — A faster process for qualifying proposals.

**What to look for in design review materials:**

- **Context analysis** — How the building relates to surrounding structures, street patterns, and the pedestrian environment.
- **Massing and site plan** — The building's overall shape, height, setbacks, and how it meets the street.
- **Departures requested** — The applicant may request flexibility from Land Use Code standards (e.g., reduced setbacks, modified facade requirements). These must be justified by design merit.
- **Design guidelines** — Each neighborhood has specific [design guidelines](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/design-review/design-guidelines) that the project must address. Board members and the public evaluate projects against these guidelines.

**2025 changes:** Washington State House Bill 1293 (effective June 30, 2025) requires all design standards to be "clear and objective" and limits projects to one public meeting. SDCI has developed interim rules while working on permanent program changes. ([SDCI: 2025 Design Review Program Changes](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/2025-design-review-program-changes))

([SDCI: Research a Project](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/resources/research-a-project))

## How to participate in public comment

### When to comment

Planning documents have defined public comment periods. Missing the window means your input won't be part of the official record.

| Process | Comment period | How to comment |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| SEPA DNS or MDNS | 14 days from notice | Written comments to SDCI via Seattle Services Portal |
| Draft EIS | Minimum 30 days (often 45) | Written comments to lead agency; public hearings may be held |
| Comprehensive plan amendments | Varies; typically 30-60 days | Written comments to OPCD; testimony at City Council hearings |
| Design Review Board meetings | Before and during meetings | Written comments via [SDCI Comment on a Project](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/design-review) or verbal testimony at the meeting (1-2 minutes per speaker) |
| MUP decisions | 14-day appeal period after decision | Appeals filed with the [Hearing Examiner](https://www.seattle.gov/hearing-examiner) |

### Tips for effective public comments

**Be specific and cite the document.** Reference specific sections, page numbers, or policy numbers. "The Draft EIS understates traffic impacts at the intersection of Rainier Ave S and S McClellan St (Section 3.5, Table 3.5-4)" is more useful than "this will cause traffic problems."

**Focus on substance, not opposition.** Public comment is not a vote. Agencies must respond to substantive comments about the analysis, alternatives, or impacts. Comments that simply say "I oppose this project" carry less weight than comments identifying analytical gaps or proposing alternatives.

**Ask questions the document should answer.** If the SEPA checklist doesn't address stormwater impacts on an adjacent creek, or the EIS doesn't analyze a reasonable alternative, point that out. Agencies are required to respond to these gaps.

**Propose alternatives or mitigation.** Suggesting a specific design change, a different building height, or an additional traffic study gives the decision-maker something actionable.

**Submit in writing.** Written comments become part of the permanent record. If you also testify verbally at a hearing, submit the same comments in writing to ensure they're captured accurately.

**Meet the deadline.** Late comments may not receive a formal response and won't be part of the official record for appeals.

### Appealing a decision

Most SDCI land use and SEPA decisions can be appealed to the Seattle **[Hearing Examiner](https://www.seattle.gov/hearing-examiner)**, an independent office that conducts administrative hearings. Appeals must be filed within 14 days of the decision and require a filing fee. The Hearing Examiner conducts an open-record hearing where parties can present evidence and testimony. ([Seattle Hearing Examiner](https://www.seattle.gov/hearing-examiner))

## Advocacy organizations

Several organizations help Seattle residents navigate planning documents and participate in public processes:

- **[Futurewise](https://futurewise.org/):** Statewide organization that tracks Growth Management Act compliance and comprehensive plan updates.
- **[Housing Development Consortium](https://www.housingconsortium.org/):** Coalition of over 215 organizations advocating for affordable housing policy in Seattle and King County. Provides analysis of land use and housing legislation.
- **[Seattle Neighborhood Greenways](https://www.seattlegreenways.org/):** Tracks transportation planning documents and organizes community input on street projects.
- **[The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/):** Publishes detailed analysis of planning documents, EIS findings, and zoning changes as they are released.
