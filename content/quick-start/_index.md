# Seattle Quick Start

You want to understand what's going on with urban development in Seattle. Here's the big picture -- enough context to follow the news, understand the debates, and show up informed to community meetings.

## The basics: how Seattle is governed

Seattle uses a **mayor-council** form of government:

- **The Mayor** runs city departments (SDOT, SDCI, Office of Housing, etc.) and proposes the budget
- **The City Council** (7 district seats + 2 at-large) passes laws, approves the budget, and confirms appointments
- **The Planning Commission** advises on long-range planning but doesn't have binding authority

Most of the urbanist action happens through:
- **SDOT** (Seattle Department of Transportation) -- streets, bikes, transit priority
- **SDCI** (Seattle Dept. of Construction & Inspections) -- building permits, code enforcement
- **Office of Planning & Community Development (OPCD)** -- comprehensive planning, zoning policy
- **Office of Housing** -- affordable housing programs and funding
- **Sound Transit** -- regional transit (Link light rail, Sounder, ST Express) -- this is a *regional* agency, not a city one

## The big picture: Seattle's growth story

Seattle has been one of the fastest-growing major cities in the US. Key forces:

1. **The tech boom** brought massive job growth (Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google) and drove housing costs up
2. **The Growth Management Act** (state law, 1990) requires growth to happen *within* urban boundaries, not by sprawling outward
3. **Single-family zoning** covered ~75% of residential land until recent reforms, concentrating all density into a few corridors
4. **Light rail expansion** (ST2, ST3) is reshaping which areas are connected and where development pressure goes

The result: a city wrestling with how to grow equitably, where to put housing, and how to move people without everyone driving.

## What's happening right now

### Comprehensive plan (One Seattle Plan)

Seattle adopted a major update to its comprehensive plan in 2024. Key changes:
- Moving away from concentrating growth only in "urban villages"
- Allowing more housing types (duplexes, triplexes, small apartments) in formerly single-family zones
- Stronger commitments to transit-oriented development around light rail stations

### Light rail expansion

Sound Transit's Link light rail is expanding significantly:
- **Already open:** 1 Line from Lynnwood to Angle Lake
- **Under construction:** Extensions to Federal Way, downtown Redmond
- **Planned:** West Seattle and Ballard extensions (though timelines keep shifting)

### Housing affordability

Despite a building boom, Seattle remains expensive. Active policy levers:
- **MHA** (Mandatory Housing Affordability) -- requires affordable units or fees from new development
- **Social housing** -- voters created a new Seattle Social Housing Developer (PDA) in 2023
- **ADU/DADU expansion** -- backyard cottages and basement apartments now allowed citywide

### Street safety and bike network

Seattle adopted Vision Zero (goal of zero traffic deaths) in 2015, but deaths have increased. Active efforts:
- Protected bike lane network buildout
- RapidRide bus rapid transit expansion
- Neighborhood greenways and traffic calming

## How to get involved

### Attending meetings

- **City Council meetings** -- Public comment is open. Agendas posted on [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov/council)
- **SDOT open houses** -- For specific projects (bike lanes, transit corridors)
- **Sound Transit Board meetings** -- For regional transit decisions
- **Design Review Board** -- For major development projects in your neighborhood
- **Neighborhood District Councils** -- Vary by area, some more active than others

### Making your voice heard

1. **Public comment** -- Most city processes have formal comment periods. Written comments count.
2. **Contact your councilmember** -- District reps are responsive to constituent input, especially on land use issues.
3. **Join an org** -- Seattle Subway, The Urbanist, Futurewise, Seattle Greenways all welcome volunteers.
4. **Show up** -- In-person attendance at meetings gets noticed by decision-makers.
