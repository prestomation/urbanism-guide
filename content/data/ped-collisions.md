# Pedestrian Collision Analysis

Interactive charts built from [SDOT's collision dataset](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::sdot-collisions-all-years), filtered to pedestrian-involved incidents (`PEDCOUNT >= 1`). Data is fetched live from Seattle's ArcGIS open data API each time you load this page.
