Think backyard cottages or basement apartments. Seattle has been loosening ADU rules since 2019 to allow more housing in single-family zones.\nWhy it matters: ADUs are one of the gentlest ways to add housing in existing neighborhoods without changing their character dramatically. They\u0026rsquo;re a key part of Seattle\u0026rsquo;s strategy to add \u0026ldquo;missing middle\u0026rdquo; housing.\nSee also: DADU, Missing Middle Housing\nDADU (Detached Accessory Dwelling Unit)# An ADU that\u0026rsquo;s a separate structure from the main house \u0026ndash; typically a backyard cottage. As of 2019, Seattle allows both an attached ADU and a DADU on most single-family lots.\nSee also: ADU\nFAR (Floor Area Ratio)# The ratio of a building\u0026rsquo;s total floor area to the size of its lot. A FAR of 1.0 means you can build total floor space equal to the lot size (e.g., a one-story building covering the whole lot, or a two-story building covering half). Higher FAR = denser development allowed.\nWhy it matters: FAR limits are one of the main tools the city uses to control how big buildings can be in different zones. When people talk about \u0026ldquo;upzoning,\u0026rdquo; they often mean increasing the allowed FAR.\nSee also: Upzoning, Zoning\nMHA (Mandatory Housing Affordability)# Seattle\u0026rsquo;s program requiring developers of commercial and multifamily buildings to include affordable units or pay into a fund for affordable housing. Passed in 2019 alongside upzones in many neighborhoods.\nWhy it matters: MHA is Seattle\u0026rsquo;s main mechanism for connecting new development to affordable housing production. It\u0026rsquo;s controversial \u0026ndash; developers say it raises costs; advocates say it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go far enough.\nSee also: Upzoning, Affordable Housing\nMissing Middle Housing# Housing types between single-family homes and large apartment buildings: duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses, courtyard apartments. Historically banned in most Seattle residential zones.\nWhy it matters: Seattle\u0026rsquo;s 2024 comprehensive plan update and related zoning changes are opening up much of the city to missing middle housing for the first time in decades. This is one of the biggest zoning shifts in the city\u0026rsquo;s history.\nSee also: ADU, Upzoning\nSingle-Family Zoning# Zoning that only allows one house per lot. Seattle had roughly 75% of its residential land zoned single-family until recent reforms. The city has been gradually renaming and reforming these zones (now called \u0026ldquo;Neighborhood Residential\u0026rdquo;) to allow more housing types.\nWhy it matters: Single-family zoning is the legacy framework that restricted density across most of Seattle. Understanding it is key to understanding why housing is so expensive and why reform is contentious.\nSee also: Missing Middle Housing, Upzoning\nUpzoning# Changing zoning rules to allow larger or denser buildings than previously permitted. Can mean increasing building height limits, FAR, or allowed unit counts.\nWhy it matters: Upzoning is one of the most debated topics in Seattle land use. Proponents say it\u0026rsquo;s essential for housing affordability and climate goals. Opponents worry about neighborhood character, displacement, and infrastructure strain.\nSee also: FAR, MHA, Single-Family Zoning\nAffordable Housing# Housing where residents pay no more than 30% of their income on rent/mortgage. In Seattle policy, \u0026ldquo;affordable\u0026rdquo; usually means affordable to households earning a percentage of Area Median Income (AMI) \u0026ndash; often 60% or 80% AMI.\nWhy it matters: Seattle\u0026rsquo;s AMI is high (~$120k for a family of four), so \u0026ldquo;affordable at 80% AMI\u0026rdquo; still means rents that many people can\u0026rsquo;t afford. Understanding the AMI benchmarks helps you evaluate whether affordable housing proposals will actually serve the people who need them.\nSee also: MHA, AMI\nThis page is a work in progress.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the big picture \u0026ndash; enough context to follow the news, understand the debates, and show up informed to community meetings.\nThe basics: how Seattle is governed# Seattle uses a mayor-council form of government:\nThe Mayor runs city departments (SDOT, SDCI, Office of Housing, etc.) and proposes the budget The City Council (7 district seats + 2 at-large) passes laws, approves the budget, and confirms appointments The Planning Commission advises on long-range planning but doesn\u0026rsquo;t have binding authority Most of the urbanist action happens through:\nSDOT (Seattle Department of Transportation) \u0026ndash; streets, bikes, transit priority SDCI (Seattle Dept. of Construction \u0026amp; Inspections) \u0026ndash; building permits, code enforcement Office of Planning \u0026amp; Community Development (OPCD) \u0026ndash; comprehensive planning, zoning policy Office of Housing \u0026ndash; affordable housing programs and funding Sound Transit \u0026ndash; regional transit (Link light rail, Sounder, ST Express) \u0026ndash; this is a regional agency, not a city one The big picture: Seattle\u0026rsquo;s growth story# Seattle has been one of the fastest-growing major cities in the US. Key forces:\nThe tech boom brought massive job growth (Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google) and drove housing costs up The Growth Management Act (state law, 1990) requires growth to happen within urban boundaries, not by sprawling outward Single-family zoning covered ~75% of residential land until recent reforms, concentrating all density into a few corridors Light rail expansion (ST2, ST3) is reshaping which areas are connected and where development pressure goes The result: a city wrestling with how to grow equitably, where to put housing, and how to move people without everyone driving.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening right now# Comprehensive plan (One Seattle Plan)# Seattle adopted a major update to its comprehensive plan in 2024. Key changes:\nMoving away from concentrating growth only in \u0026ldquo;urban villages\u0026rdquo; Allowing more housing types (duplexes, triplexes, small apartments) in formerly single-family zones Stronger commitments to transit-oriented development around light rail stations Light rail expansion# Sound Transit\u0026rsquo;s Link light rail is expanding significantly:\nAlready open: 1 Line from Lynnwood to Angle Lake Under construction: Extensions to Federal Way, downtown Redmond Planned: West Seattle and Ballard extensions (though timelines keep shifting) Housing affordability# Despite a building boom, Seattle remains expensive. Active policy levers:\nMHA (Mandatory Housing Affordability) \u0026ndash; requires affordable units or fees from new development Social housing \u0026ndash; voters created a new Seattle Social Housing Developer (PDA) in 2023 ADU/DADU expansion \u0026ndash; backyard cottages and basement apartments now allowed citywide Street safety and bike network# Seattle adopted Vision Zero (goal of zero traffic deaths) in 2015, but deaths have increased.

May include wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, bus-only lanes, and traffic calming.\nWhy it matters: Seattle adopted a Complete Streets policy, and it shapes how SDOT designs road projects. When a street gets rebuilt, advocates can push for complete streets elements using this framework.\nSee also: LOS, Vision Zero, Mode Share\nLOS (Level of Service)# A grading system (A through F) for traffic flow, where A means free-flowing and F means gridlock. Traditionally used to evaluate intersections and roads from a car driver\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nWhy it matters: LOS has historically been used to block dense development or transit projects because they\u0026rsquo;d \u0026ldquo;worsen traffic.\u0026rdquo; Urbanists argue that LOS is a car-centric metric that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t drive land use decisions. Washington state passed reforms allowing cities to use alternative metrics.\nSee also: VMT, Complete Streets\nMode Share# The percentage of trips taken by each transportation mode (driving, transit, biking, walking). Seattle\u0026rsquo;s goal is to reduce the car mode share and increase all other modes.\nWhy it matters: Mode share is how we measure whether investments in transit, bike lanes, and walkability are actually changing behavior. Seattle\u0026rsquo;s downtown has seen significant mode shift away from cars, but most neighborhoods are still car-dominant.\nSee also: VMT, Complete Streets\nST3 (Sound Transit 3)# The $54 billion regional transit expansion plan approved by voters in 2016. Includes light rail extensions to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and other areas. Full build-out expected by 2041+.\nWhy it matters: ST3 is the biggest infrastructure investment in the region\u0026rsquo;s history. Delays and cost overruns have been controversial. Understanding the project timeline and station locations is essential for following development patterns.\nSee also: TOD, Link Light Rail\nTOD (Transit-Oriented Development)# Higher-density, mixed-use development concentrated near transit stations. The idea is that people living/working near good transit will drive less.\nWhy it matters: With Link light rail expanding, TOD around new stations is one of the biggest development opportunities in Seattle\u0026rsquo;s history. Station area planning determines whether these areas become walkable neighborhoods or park-and-ride wastelands.\nSee also: ST3, Upzoning\nVision Zero# A policy commitment to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Seattle adopted Vision Zero in 2015.\nWhy it matters: Despite the commitment, Seattle\u0026rsquo;s traffic deaths have been increasing. Vision Zero gives advocates a framework to demand safer street design, lower speed limits, and enforcement \u0026ndash; the city has committed to this goal and can be held accountable.\nSee also: Complete Streets\nVMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)# Total miles driven by vehicles in an area. An alternative to LOS for measuring transportation system performance that doesn\u0026rsquo;t privilege car throughput.\nWhy it matters: Washington now allows cities to use VMT instead of LOS for evaluating development impacts. This is a significant policy shift that can unlock denser development near transit.\nSee also: LOS, Mode Share\nThis page is a work in progress.

Required by Washington\u0026rsquo;s Growth Management Act. Seattle\u0026rsquo;s comp plan is updated on major cycles (most recently 2024) and guides zoning and investment decisions for 20+ years.\nWhy it matters: The comprehensive plan is the single most important policy document for Seattle\u0026rsquo;s future. It determines where growth goes, what gets built, and how the city invests. The 2024 update was a major battleground over density, equity, and neighborhood change.\nSee also: GMA, Zoning\nEIS (Environmental Impact Statement)# A detailed study of a project\u0026rsquo;s or plan\u0026rsquo;s environmental effects, required under SEPA for major actions. Covers traffic, noise, shadow, displacement, and more.\nWhy it matters: EIS processes can add years and millions of dollars to projects. They\u0026rsquo;re an important environmental protection but also get used strategically to delay development or infrastructure. Understanding when an EIS is required helps you follow major project timelines.\nSee also: SEPA\nGMA (Growth Management Act)# Washington state law (1990) requiring urban areas to plan for growth, protect rural land, and provide infrastructure. Mandates comprehensive plans and urban growth boundaries.\nWhy it matters: The GMA is why Seattle has to plan for growth rather than sprawling indefinitely. It\u0026rsquo;s the legal framework behind comprehensive plans, urban growth boundaries, and concurrency requirements. Recent GMA updates have pushed cities toward more housing production.\nSee also: Comprehensive Plan, Urban Growth Boundary\nSEPA (State Environmental Policy Act)# Washington\u0026rsquo;s environmental review law. Requires government agencies to evaluate environmental impacts before approving projects, plans, or permits.\nWhy it matters: SEPA review is a common step in development and planning that can significantly affect timelines. It\u0026rsquo;s also a tool that community members can use to raise concerns about projects. Knowing what SEPA covers helps you participate meaningfully in public comment periods.\nSee also: EIS\nUrban Growth Boundary (UGB)# A line on the map separating urban areas (where growth is directed) from rural areas (which are preserved). King County\u0026rsquo;s UGB limits sprawl and concentrates development.\nWhy it matters: The UGB is why Seattle must grow up rather than out. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the strongest anti-sprawl tools in the country and directly drives the density debates within city limits.\nSee also: GMA, Comprehensive Plan\nUrban Village# Seattle\u0026rsquo;s planning designation for neighborhood centers that are targeted for growth. Includes hubs like Capitol Hill, the U-District, and Ballard, as well as smaller \u0026ldquo;residential urban villages.\u0026rdquo; Created in the 1994 comprehensive plan.\nWhy it matters: Urban villages have been the framework for where Seattle directs growth for 30 years. The 2024 comp plan update is shifting away from this model toward more distributed growth, which is a significant conceptual change.\nSee also: Comprehensive Plan\nZoning# Government rules that dictate what can be built where \u0026ndash; building height, density, use (residential, commercial, industrial), setbacks, lot coverage, etc.\nWhy it matters: Zoning is the fundamental tool that shapes what Seattle looks like. Almost every land use debate comes down to zoning. If you understand zoning basics, you can follow most development controversies.\nSee also: FAR, Upzoning, Comprehensive Plan\nThis page is a work in progress.

Decades of decisions \u0026ndash; some visionary, some disastrous \u0026ndash; shaped the city you see today. This timeline highlights the key moments that matter for understanding current debates.\n1907 The Bogue Plan Virgil Bogue proposes a grand civic plan for Seattle including a civic center, park system, and arterial highways. Voters reject it in 1912.\nLegacy: The rejection set a pattern: Seattle repeatedly struggles with big, centralized planning visions vs. incremental, neighborhood-driven change.\nplanning 1928 First Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Seattle adopts its first citywide zoning code, separating residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Single-family zones cover the vast majority of residential land.\nLegacy: This zoning framework -- with single-family dominance -- persisted largely unchanged for nearly a century and is the root of many current housing debates.\nzoning housing 1941 Yesler Terrace Opens Seattle\u0026#39;s first public housing project opens. It was notably one of the first racially integrated public housing projects in the US.\nLegacy: Yesler Terrace was eventually redeveloped starting in 2013 into a mixed-income community, illustrating the evolution of public housing philosophy.\nhousing equity 1962 Century 21 Exposition (World\u0026#39;s Fair) The Seattle World\u0026#39;s Fair transforms Lower Queen Anne with the Space Needle, Monorail, and what becomes Seattle Center. The Monorail was intended as the start of a citywide system.\nLegacy: The Monorail\u0026#39;s legacy is complicated -- it showed Seattle could build transit, but the 1.3-mile line became a symbol of unfulfilled transit ambitions. Subsequent monorail proposals failed.\ntransit planning 1968 Forward Thrust Transit Plan King County voters approve a regional transit plan including a 47-mile rail system. But it needed 60% approval for federal matching funds and got only 50.8%. The federal money went to Atlanta\u0026#39;s MARTA instead.\nLegacy: Arguably the most consequential urbanist vote in Seattle\u0026#39;s history. If Forward Thrust had passed, Seattle would have had a rail system decades earlier. The city\u0026#39;s car-dependent development patterns of the 1970s-90s can be partially traced to this failure.\ntransit 1970 Freeway Revolts Community activism stops planned freeways through the Central District, Ravenna, and along the waterfront (R.H. Thomson Expressway and Bay Freeway). Seattle removes the planned routes from its plans.\nLegacy: The freeway revolts saved several neighborhoods from destruction and established a pattern of community resistance to highway expansion that continues today (see: waterfront tunnel, I-5 lid proposals).\ntransit planning community 1990 Growth Management Act (GMA) Washington State passes the Growth Management Act, requiring cities to plan for growth within urban growth boundaries and protect rural land.\nLegacy: The GMA is why Seattle must grow *up* rather than *out*. It\u0026#39;s the legal foundation for comprehensive planning, urban growth boundaries, and the density debates that define Seattle urbanism.\nplanning housing 1994 Seattle\u0026#39;s Comprehensive Plan \u0026amp; Urban Villages Seattle adopts a comprehensive plan organizing growth around \u0026#39;urban villages\u0026#39; -- designated neighborhood centers where density is directed. Most residential land remains single-family.\nLegacy: The urban village strategy shaped 30 years of development, concentrating apartments and mixed-use in corridors while protecting single-family neighborhoods. The 2024 comp plan update finally moves away from this framework.\nplanning zoning 1996 Sound Transit Created Voters approve Sound Move (later called ST1), creating Sound Transit and funding the first light rail line, commuter rail (Sounder), and express buses.\nLegacy: After decades of failed transit proposals, this vote finally committed the region to building rail. Everything in Seattle\u0026#39;s current transit expansion traces back to this decision.\ntransit 2003 Seattle Monorail Project Approved and Collapsed Voters approve a citywide monorail plan for the fourth time, but the Seattle Monorail Project collapses in 2005 due to cost overruns and financing problems.\nLegacy: The monorail failure made Seattle voters skeptical of transit proposals for years and reinforced Sound Transit\u0026#39;s position as the region\u0026#39;s transit builder.\ntransit 2009 Link Light Rail Opens Sound Transit\u0026#39;s Central Link light rail opens between downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport. The first segment of what would become the region\u0026#39;s rail backbone.\nLegacy: Link light rail fundamentally changed development patterns along its route. The Rainier Valley, Capitol Hill, and University District all saw significant development driven by station access.\ntransit 2014 $15 Minimum Wage Seattle passes a landmark $15/hour minimum wage, the first major US city to do so.\nLegacy: While not strictly an urbanism issue, the minimum wage law reflected Seattle\u0026#39;s progressive politics and its grappling with affordability as a growing, expensive city.\nequity policy 2015 Vision Zero Adopted Seattle commits to eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The plan prioritizes investments on high-crash corridors and emphasizes engineering over enforcement.\nLegacy: Despite the commitment, traffic deaths have increased since adoption. Vision Zero remains important as a policy framework advocates use to push for safer streets.\ntransit safety 2016 ST3 Approved Voters approve Sound Transit 3, a $54 billion expansion including light rail to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.\nLegacy: ST3 will define the region\u0026#39;s urban form for decades. Station locations are already driving development patterns and zoning discussions, even before lines open.\ntransit 2019 MHA and ADU Reforms Seattle implements Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) with upzones in many neighborhoods. ADU/DADU rules are also loosened, allowing backyard cottages on most single-family lots.\nLegacy: MHA was the first significant upzoning across Seattle in decades. Combined with ADU reforms, it began to chip away at single-family exclusivity -- a process the 2024 comp plan accelerated dramatically.\nhousing zoning 2023 Social Housing Initiative (I-135) Seattle voters approve Initiative 135, creating a new public development authority to build mixed-income social housing (not means-tested, cross-subsidized).\nLegacy: The Social Housing Developer represents a new model for Seattle -- publicly developed housing that serves a range of incomes. It\u0026#39;s still early, but it could become a significant housing tool.\nhousing equity 2024 One Seattle Comprehensive Plan Update Seattle adopts a major update to its comprehensive plan, allowing more housing types across the city, strengthening TOD requirements, and moving away from the urban village framework.\nLegacy: This is the biggest change to Seattle\u0026#39;s land use framework in 30 years. It opens formerly single-family areas to duplexes, triplexes, and more, and sets the stage for station area planning around new light rail.\nplanning zoning housing How to read this timeline# Each entry includes:\nWhat happened \u0026ndash; The event, policy, or decision Why it mattered \u0026ndash; How it shaped what came after Legacy \u0026ndash; How it connects to today\u0026rsquo;s debates The entries are deliberately selective.

Seattle has been slow to adopt impact fees compared to other cities.\nWhy it matters: Impact fees are a perpetual debate in Seattle. Developers argue they raise housing costs. Advocates say new development should pay for the infrastructure it requires. Whether and how Seattle implements impact fees affects both housing affordability and public services.\nMFTE (Multifamily Tax Exemption)# A city program that gives property tax breaks to developers who include affordable units in new apartment buildings. The tax exemption lasts 12 years.\nWhy it matters: MFTE is one of Seattle\u0026rsquo;s main tools for getting affordable units built in market-rate projects. When MFTE buildings\u0026rsquo; exemptions expire, those affordable units can go to market rate \u0026ndash; creating a slow-motion affordability cliff.\nSee also: MHA, Affordable Housing\nMove Seattle Levy# A 9-year, $930 million property tax levy (2015-2024) funding transportation projects including bus speed improvements, bike lanes, bridge maintenance, and sidewalk repairs.

Understanding levy cycles helps you know when to advocate for specific projects and how they\u0026rsquo;re funded.\nREET (Real Estate Excise Tax)# A tax on property sales that funds affordable housing, parks, and infrastructure. Washington recently gave cities more flexibility to use REET funds for affordable housing.\nWhy it matters: REET is a significant funding source for affordable housing in Seattle. Changes to how REET revenue can be used directly affect the city\u0026rsquo;s ability to build and preserve affordable units.\nTIF (Tax Increment Financing)# A financing tool where future property tax increases in a designated area are used to pay for current infrastructure investments in that area. Not currently authorized in Washington state, though there have been legislative efforts to enable it.\nWhy it matters: TIF is widely used in other states to fund transit-oriented development, affordable housing, and infrastructure.
