Single-family zones cover the vast majority of residential land.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> This zoning framework -- with single-family dominance -- persisted largely unchanged for nearly a century and is the root of many current housing debates.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>zoning</span>

It was notably one of the first racially integrated public housing projects in the US.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> Yesler Terrace was eventually redeveloped starting in 2013 into a mixed-income community, illustrating the evolution of public housing philosophy.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>housing</span>

The Monorail was intended as the start of a citywide system.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> The Monorail's legacy is complicated -- it showed Seattle could build transit, but the 1.3-mile line became a symbol of unfulfilled transit ambitions. Subsequent monorail proposals failed.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span>

But it needed 60% approval for federal matching funds and got only 50.8%. The federal money went to Atlanta's MARTA instead.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> Arguably the most consequential urbanist vote in Seattle's history. If Forward Thrust had passed, Seattle would have had a rail system decades earlier. The city's car-dependent development patterns of the 1970s-90s can be partially traced to this failure.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span></div></div></div><div class=timeline-entry data-year=1970><div class=timeline-marker><span class=timeline-year>1970</span></div><div class=timeline-content><h3>Freeway Revolts</h3><p>Community activism stops planned freeways through the Central District, Ravenna, and along the waterfront (R.H. Thomson Expressway and Bay Freeway). Seattle removes the planned routes from its plans.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> The freeway revolts saved several neighborhoods from destruction and established a pattern of community resistance to highway expansion that continues today (see: waterfront tunnel, I-5 lid proposals).</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span>

It's the legal foundation for comprehensive planning, urban growth boundaries, and the density debates that define Seattle urbanism.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>planning</span>

Most residential land remains single-family.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> The urban village strategy shaped 30 years of development, concentrating apartments and mixed-use in corridors while protecting single-family neighborhoods. The 2024 comp plan update finally moves away from this framework.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>planning</span>

Everything in Seattle's current transit expansion traces back to this decision.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span></div></div></div><div class=timeline-entry data-year=2003><div class=timeline-marker><span class=timeline-year>2003</span></div><div class=timeline-content><h3>Seattle Monorail Project Approved and Collapsed</h3><p>Voters approve a citywide monorail plan for the fourth time, but the Seattle Monorail Project collapses in 2005 due to cost overruns and financing problems.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> The monorail failure made Seattle voters skeptical of transit proposals for years and reinforced Sound Transit's position as the region's transit builder.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span></div></div></div><div class=timeline-entry data-year=2009><div class=timeline-marker><span class=timeline-year>2009</span></div><div class=timeline-content><h3>Link Light Rail Opens</h3><p>Sound Transit's Central Link light rail opens between downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport. The first segment of what would become the region's rail backbone.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> Link light rail fundamentally changed development patterns along its route. The Rainier Valley, Capitol Hill, and University District all saw significant development driven by station access.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span></div></div></div><div class=timeline-entry data-year=2014><div class=timeline-marker><span class=timeline-year>2014</span></div><div class=timeline-content><h3>$15 Minimum Wage</h3><p>Seattle passes a landmark $15/hour minimum wage, the first major US city to do so.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> While not strictly an urbanism issue, the minimum wage law reflected Seattle's progressive politics and its grappling with affordability as a growing, expensive city.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>equity</span>

The plan prioritizes investments on high-crash corridors and emphasizes engineering over enforcement.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> Despite the commitment, traffic deaths have increased since adoption. Vision Zero remains important as a policy framework advocates use to push for safer streets.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span>

Station locations are already driving development patterns and zoning discussions, even before lines open.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>transit</span></div></div></div><div class=timeline-entry data-year=2019><div class=timeline-marker><span class=timeline-year>2019</span></div><div class=timeline-content><h3>MHA and ADU Reforms</h3><p>Seattle implements Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) with upzones in many neighborhoods. ADU/DADU rules are also loosened, allowing backyard cottages on most single-family lots.</p><p class=timeline-legacy><strong>Legacy:</strong> MHA was the first significant upzoning across Seattle in decades. Combined with ADU reforms, it began to chip away at single-family exclusivity -- a process the 2024 comp plan accelerated dramatically.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>housing</span>

It's still early, but it could become a significant housing tool.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>housing</span>

It opens formerly single-family areas to duplexes, triplexes, and more, and sets the stage for station area planning around new light rail.</p><div class=timeline-tags><span class=timeline-tag>planning</span>
