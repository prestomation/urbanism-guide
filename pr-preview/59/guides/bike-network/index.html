They provide the safety of an off-street trail with the convenience of a bike lane. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/protected-bike-lanes>SDOT Protected Bike Lanes</a>)</p><p>Seattle has been replacing older &ldquo;paint and post&rdquo; flex-post barriers with hardened materials like concrete curbs (Toronto barriers), recycled rubber separators, and precast flat-top curbs through the <strong>Even Better Bike Lanes</strong> program. In 2024, SDOT replaced over 700 flex-posts with durable barriers, with a goal to upgrade 30% of the protected bike lane network. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/better-bike-lanes>SDOT Even Better Bike Lanes</a>)</p><h3 id=neighborhood-greenways>Neighborhood greenways<a class=anchor href=#neighborhood-greenways>#</a></h3><p>Neighborhood greenways are low-traffic residential streets where walking and biking are the priority. They use traffic calming features to slow cars and discourage cut-through traffic while making it safer and more comfortable for people on foot and on bikes. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program>SDOT Greenways Program</a>)</p><p>Typical greenway features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed humps</strong> to reduce vehicle speeds</li><li><strong>Crossing improvements</strong> at busy intersections (flashing beacons, curb bulbs, new traffic signals)</li><li><strong>Wayfinding signs and pavement markings</strong> to guide riders along the route</li><li><strong>Stop signs</strong> for cross-streets to give greenway users priority</li><li><strong>Traffic diverters</strong> to block cut-through driving on some corridors</li></ul><p>Greenways are organized into five geographic areas: Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southeast, and Southwest Seattle. Since 2012, Seattle has built over 40 miles of neighborhood greenways.</p><h3 id=trails-and-multi-use-paths>Trails and multi-use paths<a class=anchor href=#trails-and-multi-use-paths>#</a></h3><p>Seattle also has a system of off-street trails separated from roads entirely. Key trails include the Burke-Gilman Trail, Elliott Bay Trail, Ship Canal Trail, Mountains to Sound Trail, Interurban Trail, and the Duwamish Trail. These trails connect to on-street protected bike lanes and greenways to form longer routes.</p><h2 id=history>History<a class=anchor href=#history>#</a></h2><h3 id=2007-first-bicycle-master-plan>2007: First Bicycle Master Plan<a class=anchor href=#2007-first-bicycle-master-plan>#</a></h3><p>Seattle adopted its first comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan in 2007, a 10-year effort with an estimated cost of $240 million. Under that plan, the city created 38 miles of new bike lanes, 54 miles of sharrow lanes, and 29 miles of signed neighborhood routes. However, the plan focused on painted bike lanes and sharrows rather than physically protected facilities.</p><h3 id=2012-first-neighborhood-greenways>2012: First neighborhood greenways<a class=anchor href=#2012-first-neighborhood-greenways>#</a></h3><p>Seattle began piloting neighborhood greenways in 2012, starting with corridors on N 43rd/44th Streets in Wallingford and 39th Avenue NE in Wedgwood. The concept followed Portland, Oregon, which had been implementing similar &ldquo;bike boulevard&rdquo; corridors since the 1980s.

The two-way cycle track replaced a narrow painted bike lane on a street that had seen more than 60 crashes in four years. Mayor Ed Murray fast-tracked the project after a cyclist was killed on 2nd Avenue in August 2014. Ridership on the corridor jumped 400% after the protected lane was installed.

The levy also funded the Safe Routes to School program, which coordinates with greenway planning.

The $5 million project was funded by a federal grant and the Move Seattle Levy.

The closures saw a 357% increase in walking and a 111% increase in biking. Mayor Durkan committed to making at least 20 miles permanent, and the program was later renamed <strong>Healthy Streets</strong>.

Advocates raised concerns that the consolidated plan might deprioritize bike infrastructure.</p><p>Voters also approved the 8-year, $1.55 billion <strong>Seattle Transportation Levy</strong>, which includes $114 million for bike safety. The levy funds approximately 10 miles of new protected bike lanes and the Even Better Bike Lanes hardened-barrier upgrade program.
