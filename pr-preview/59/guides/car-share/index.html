The reasons fall into structural, economic, and Seattle-specific categories.</p><h3 id=the-economics-never-worked>The economics never worked<a class=anchor href=#the-economics-never-worked>#</a></h3><p>The core problem was cost. Colin Murphy of the Shared-Use Mobility Center summarized it: &ldquo;The short answer is that the costs didn&rsquo;t work out. Free-floating just adds a layer of labor costs on top of a very low-margin business.&rdquo; (<a href=https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/gig-car-sharing-startup-is-dead-why-is-car-share-so-difficult>Next City</a>)</p><p>Operating costs included vehicle purchase or lease payments, insurance, maintenance, fuel, parking permits, and — critically — <strong>rebalancing</strong>: physically moving idle cars from low-demand areas to high-demand ones. Share Now reported that roughly 1 in 5 vehicles required manual relocation. These costs could not be covered at prices competitive with private car ownership or ride-hailing.</p><h3 id=ride-hailing-competition>Ride-hailing competition<a class=anchor href=#ride-hailing-competition>#</a></h3><p>Uber and Lyft offered a more convenient alternative. With ride-hailing, the car comes to you; with car sharing, you walk to wherever the nearest car happens to be parked. For most trips, the convenience gap outweighed the cost difference.</p><h3 id=the-luxury-vehicle-mistake>The luxury vehicle mistake<a class=anchor href=#the-luxury-vehicle-mistake>#</a></h3><p>car2go&rsquo;s 2017 decision to replace its affordable Smart Fortwo fleet with Mercedes-Benz vehicles raised per-minute rates by 20% and increased maintenance costs. The UW Sustainable Transportation Lab warned at the time that the switch would disproportionately affect lower-income users and undermine the service&rsquo;s value proposition. (<a href=https://sites.uw.edu/stlab/2017/10/27/sustainability-of-car2go-abandoning-smart-cars/>UW Sustainable Transportation Lab</a>)</p><p>ReachNow launched with BMWs from the start, and car2go&rsquo;s competitive response was to go upmarket rather than double down on affordability. Neither company survived.</p><h3 id=corporate-decisions-not-local-failures>Corporate decisions, not local failures<a class=anchor href=#corporate-decisions-not-local-failures>#</a></h3><p>Both car2go/Share Now and ReachNow were shut down as consequences of the BMW-Daimler joint venture restructuring, which decided to focus on European markets. Share Now cited the &ldquo;volatile state of the global mobility landscape&rdquo; and insufficient EV charging infrastructure in North America. ReachNow&rsquo;s shutdown was so abrupt that SDOT had only hours of notice. (<a href=https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/10/01/post-mortem-car2go-is-car2gone-in-5-cities>Streetsblog USA</a>)</p><p>These were global corporate decisions, not responses to Seattle-specific conditions — though the underlying economics made North American markets less attractive than European ones.</p><h3 id=the-pandemic-disrupted-demand-patterns>The pandemic disrupted demand patterns<a class=anchor href=#the-pandemic-disrupted-demand-patterns>#</a></h3><p>Gig Car Share launched during COVID-19 and never achieved the membership density that car2go had at its peak. Post-pandemic remote work reduced commuting demand, and the service never reached critical mass.</p><h3 id=high-car-ownership-in-the-us>High car ownership in the U.S.<a class=anchor href=#high-car-ownership-in-the-us>#</a></h3><p>In European cities where free-floating car sharing thrives, the marginal cost of car ownership is high (expensive parking, fuel taxes, congestion charges). In Seattle, parking is relatively cheap outside downtown, and driving costs are subsidized. The marginal cost of using a car you already own is always lower than per-minute rental pricing.</p><h3 id=the-vancouver-contrast>The Vancouver contrast<a class=anchor href=#the-vancouver-contrast>#</a></h3><p>Vancouver&rsquo;s <strong>Evo</strong> carshare has thrived while Seattle&rsquo;s operators failed. An analysis in The Urbanist attributed this to Vancouver having stronger transit connections between neighborhoods, lower car ownership rates, and a transportation ecosystem more supportive of car-lite lifestyles. Car sharing works best as a complement to robust transit — not as a substitute for it.
