Neighborhoods with high displacement risk — the Chinatown-International District, Central District, Rainier Valley, and Columbia City — are home to many of the city&rsquo;s most culturally significant commercial corridors. When a longstanding Ethiopian restaurant, Vietnamese grocery, or Black-owned barbershop closes, the loss is economic and cultural.

(<a href=https://innovation-hub.seattle.gov/2023/12/07/seattle-works-to-reform-city-buying-to-drive-equity-for-minority-owned-businesses/>Seattle Innovation Hub: Reforming City Buying to Drive Equity</a>)</p><h3 id=how-displacement-happens>How displacement happens<a class=anchor href=#how-displacement-happens>#</a></h3><p>Commercial displacement operates differently from residential displacement. Small business tenants typically have fewer legal protections: commercial leases are freely negotiable, and there is no just-cause eviction requirement for commercial tenants. Although Washington&rsquo;s statewide rent control preemption (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.21.830">RCW 35.21.830</a>) applies only to residential structures, Seattle has not enacted commercial rent control — the CAAC considered and rejected it in 2016. Displacement occurs through several mechanisms:</p><ul><li><strong>Rent increases:</strong> Landlords raise rents beyond what small-margin businesses can absorb, sometimes doubling or tripling rates at lease renewal. The Commercial Affordability Advisory Committee reported in 2016 that Seattle retail rents had risen 28% in the prior four years. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/economicDevelopment/commercial_affordability_advisory_committee_report_lo_res.pdf>Seattle OED: CAAC Report (PDF)</a>)</li><li><strong>Lease non-renewal:</strong> Property owners decline to renew leases in order to sell the building, redevelop the site, or attract higher-paying tenants. Small businesses that lease their space do not have relocation rights similar to residential tenants — a landlord seeking to sell or redevelop can simply terminate the lease in accordance with its terms.

While new buildings often include ground-floor commercial space, the replacement spaces are typically larger and more expensive than what existed before. The CAAC found that 25% of existing buildings had available spaces under 1,000 square feet, compared with only 20% of buildings under construction or proposed.

In the Chinatown-International District, the cumulative impact of new luxury development has threatened the viability of longstanding culturally specific businesses.

Dearborn Street and Rainier Avenue S. — at the crossroads of Little Saigon, the Central District, the International District, and North Rainier Valley. Community groups feared the development would displace Vietnamese small businesses and change the character of surrounding neighborhoods. <strong><a href=https://pugetsoundsage.org/>Puget Sound Sage</a></strong> joined neighborhood councils, small businesses, and labor unions to negotiate a <a href=/pr-preview/59/glossary/funding-policy/#community-benefit-agreement-cba>community benefit agreement</a> (CBA) with the developer.</p><p>After nearly two years of negotiation, the 2008 agreement included 200 units of low-income housing (including 50 family units), $1.8 million for small business and nonprofit support in Little Saigon, restrictions on chain retail, $200,000 for traffic mitigation, and commitments to family-wage employment with prioritized local hiring. The project was canceled during the 2009 recession, but the Dearborn CBA was the first legally binding community benefit agreement in the Puget Sound region and established a template for future negotiations.

The committee&rsquo;s September 2016 report found that about 94% of Seattle businesses had 50 or fewer employees and that rapid redevelopment was replacing small-scale leasable spaces with larger, less affordable ones. Key recommendations included:</p><ul><li>A <strong>commercial affordability tax abatement</strong> modeled on the <a href=/pr-preview/59/glossary/funding-policy/#mfte-multifamily-tax-exemption>MFTE</a> residential program, providing property tax exemptions to landlords who lease to qualifying small businesses at below-market rates</li><li>Advocating that King County tie property tax assessments to building income rather than surrounding market values</li><li>A <strong>commercial affordability fund</strong> for low-cost financing</li><li>Zoning changes to promote small-scale commercial pockets in residential areas</li><li>Stronger design guidelines encouraging small storefronts in new development</li><li>Further study of legacy business support — which led to the Legacy Business Program</li></ul><p>The committee considered but rejected commercial rent control.

The program grew out of a 2017 study funded at the initiative of Councilmember Lisa Herbold.

Repayment schedules could not require more than one-third of late rent in any month, and no late fees or interest could be charged.

The City spent nearly $228 million with WMBE firms in 2022 for consulting and public works contracts.

CBAs emerged nationally in the late 1990s, with the first full CBA negotiated for the Los Angeles Staples Center development in 2001.</p><p>Seattle&rsquo;s most prominent CBA was the 2008 Dearborn Street agreement (described in the history section above). Although that project was canceled, the CBA model remains an active tool in the region. <strong>Puget Sound Sage</strong> continues to advocate for CBA frameworks in major developments, and the organization received a $250,000 grant in 2025 to support community-led stewardship of land in the Chinatown-International District. (<a href=https://www.nwaf.org/2025/02/20/q4-grants-puget-sound-sages-community-led-advocacy-for-seattles-chinatown/>NWAF: Puget Sound Sage CID Grant</a>)</p><p>CBAs are distinct from city-mandated requirements like <a href=/pr-preview/59/glossary/housing-zoning/#mha-mandatory-housing-affordability>MHA</a> or design review. They are negotiated directly between developers and community groups, and their enforceability depends on the specificity of the contract language. Effective CBAs include clear metrics, timelines, and enforcement mechanisms.</p><h2 id=advocacy-organizations>Advocacy organizations<a class=anchor href=#advocacy-organizations>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong><a href=https://pugetsoundsage.org/>Puget Sound Sage</a>:</strong> Research, policy, and community organizing for equitable development, transit justice, and good jobs.
