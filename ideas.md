# Content Ideas

Suggested new content for the Seattle Urbanism Guide, organized by priority.

## Tier 3: Nice to Have

### How to Read a Planning Document
Practical guide to interpreting EIS documents, comp plan amendments, SEPA checklists, and DCI permits. Directly serves the site's audience of people preparing for public hearings.

### Neighborhood-Specific Profiles
Mini-guides for areas undergoing major change. Connects policy content to real places. Each profile follows the same structure as the Rainier Valley guide: sub-neighborhoods, demographics, history, transit, displacement/development patterns, current planning, community organizations, and key statistics.

**High priority** (active station area planning, major rezones, or acute displacement pressure):

- **Central District** -- Historically Black neighborhood experiencing the most documented demographic reversal in any American city (73% Black in 1970 → 11-18% in 2020). Africatown CLT, Liberty Bank Building, 23rd Ave corridor, community preference policy in action, EDI projects, One Seattle Plan changes.
- **Chinatown-International District** -- Named to America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places (2023). Sound Transit construction impacts, I-5 lid proposals, SCIDpda, three overlapping historic districts, preservation vs. development tension, Little Saigon.
- **West Seattle** -- Bridge crisis (2020 closure, 2022 reopening), West Seattle Link Extension station area planning launching 2026 (Delridge, Junction, Avalon stations), geographic isolation, car-dependent infrastructure, Alaska Junction commercial district.
- **Ballard** -- Future Ballard Link Extension with controversial station siting, maritime/industrial heritage vs. residential development pressure, brewery district, Ballard Locks, among highest construction activity in the city, Market Street NW commercial core.

**Medium priority** (significant recent transit investment or major zoning changes):

- **Capitol Hill** -- Capitol Hill station TOD (Station House, Pride Place), Pike/Pine corridor cultural preservation, LGBTQ+ community history, density and nightlife/arts displacement pressure, Broadway commercial district.
- **University District** -- U District station and major upzoning (tallest allowed building heights outside downtown), student housing market dynamics, homelessness concentration, Ave corridor, U District Partnership BIA.
- **South Lake Union** -- Transformation from warehouse/maritime district to Amazon campus and tech hub. Streetcar, Vulcan/Paul Allen development legacy, Lake Union Park, loss of industrial character, housing affordability in a jobs-rich neighborhood.
- **Northgate** -- Northgate station (2021), Kraken Community Iceplex/NHL arena, pedestrian/bicycle bridge, 235-unit affordable TOD under construction, mall site redevelopment, new urban center designation.
- **Lake City** -- Pinehurst Station (NE 130th St) opening 2026, 145th station area planning completed, Lake City Future First initiative, one of the last affordable neighborhoods in north Seattle, high displacement risk.

**Lower priority** (substantial overlap with existing topic guides but place-specific content would add value):

- **Beacon Hill** -- Link station since 2009, diverse (large Asian community), El Centro de la Raza headquarters, Beacon Hill Food Forest, SCIDpda expanding into the neighborhood, new protected bike lanes, quiet gentrification.
- **Georgetown / South Park** -- Duwamish Valley environmental justice (overlaps EJ guide), Superfund cleanup, industrial character, cultural resilience, South Park Bridge, Duwamish Valley Action Plan, new bike infrastructure connecting to downtown.
- **First Hill / Yesler Terrace** -- SHA's largest-ever redevelopment (overlaps public housing guide), First Hill streetcar, hospital district, major density increase, Yesler Terrace Park, affordable housing replacement commitments.
- **Pioneer Square** -- Seattle's oldest neighborhood, historic district, waterfront transformation and Overlook Walk connection, homelessness concentration, Occidental Square activation, earthquake vulnerability (highest URM building density in the city).
