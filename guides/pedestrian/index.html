(<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/sidewalk-development-program>SDOT Sidewalk Development Program</a>)</p><p>Traditional concrete sidewalks cost $400,000 or more per block to construct. To close gaps faster, SDOT also builds <strong>neighborhood walkways</strong> — simplified paths using asphalt, gravel, or other materials that can often be installed for under $100,000 per block. The <strong>Seattle Transportation Levy</strong> (2024) commits to building 350 blocks of new sidewalks and walkways over eight years, with 250 in the first four years.

Treatments include marked crosswalks, pedestrian refuge islands, rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFBs), concrete curb bulbs that shorten crossing distances, and <strong>leading pedestrian intervals</strong> (LPIs) that give walkers a head start before drivers get a green light. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/crossing-improvement-program>SDOT Crossing Improvement Program</a>)</p><p>As of 2024, SDOT had installed LPIs at over 700 of the city&rsquo;s roughly 1,000 traffic signals — nearly three-quarters of locations where they are feasible. At locations with LPIs installed between 2009 and 2018, SDOT measured a 48% reduction in pedestrian turning collisions and a 34% reduction in serious injury and fatal pedestrian collisions.

City of Seattle</em> lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Washington on behalf of people with mobility disabilities. Under the consent decree, Seattle committed to building or upgrading 22,500 curb ramps over 18 years — approximately 1,250 per year — at an estimated cost of nearly $300 million.

However, when damage is caused by city-owned trees or infrastructure, SDOT&rsquo;s <strong>Sidewalk Safety Repair Program</strong> handles repairs. SDOT uses a condition rating system (excellent, good, fair, poor, very poor) to prioritize work. The 2026 levy delivery plan includes 34,000 spot repairs to sidewalks.

The program uses a Safe System Approach that layers engineering, enforcement, education, and policy changes to prevent fatal and serious crashes. Pedestrian safety became a central focus, as people walking are disproportionately represented in traffic fatalities despite making up a fraction of road users.

An Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study found the changes led to a 20% reduction in injury crash odds on downtown arterials and an 11% reduction outside the city center. A separate comprehensive study found pedestrian-involved crashes decreased 26% after implementation.
