The Board reviews nominations at public meetings and votes on whether the property meets the designation criteria. If approved, staff negotiate a <strong>Controls and Incentives Agreement</strong> with the property owner that specifies which features are protected and what incentives apply. The agreement and a designating ordinance then go to the Seattle City Council for final approval.

The neighborhood was rebuilt after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 and contains one of the nation&rsquo;s largest collections of <strong>Richardsonian Romanesque</strong> architecture. By the 1960s, city plans called for a ring road that would have demolished many of these buildings. Architects Ralph Anderson and Victor Steinbrueck led efforts to document and protect the district. In 1970, the City Council designated it as a preservation district and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The boundaries were expanded in 1978 and 1987.

Victor Steinbrueck was a leading advocate for preservation. The district protects the market&rsquo;s historic structures, uses, and character, with review of both exterior and interior changes by a 12-member Historical Commission.

Governor Ferguson signed the bill on May 12, 2025. The law prohibits cities from designating a property as a landmark without the owner&rsquo;s written consent if the property is less than 125 years old and the designation would restrict its use. Properties within existing designated historic districts are exempt. Cities must adopt complying regulations by July 26, 2026.

Housing advocates argued this created a tool for <strong>predatory delay</strong>: even if a nomination ultimately failed, the uncertainty and timeline of the landmark review process could deter builders. The Sightline Institute documented cases where the risk of landmarking alone was enough to cause small-scale housing developers to abandon projects.

Advocates also point out that preservation can serve anti-displacement goals: maintaining existing affordable buildings and neighborhood character rather than demolishing and rebuilding.

(<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives>Seattle DON: Preservation Incentives</a>)</p><h3 id=transfer-of-development-rights-tdr>Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)<a class=anchor href=#transfer-of-development-rights-tdr>#</a></h3><p>Owners of designated landmarks can sell their unused development rights to developers building in downtown and other receiving zones. This generates revenue for preservation while allowing density elsewhere. Seattle launched its TDR program in 1985. A portion of bonus floor area in downtown projects must be obtained through <strong>Landmark TDR</strong> if any are available in the city&rsquo;s TDR Bank. (<a href=https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/historic-preservation/preservation-incentives>Seattle DON: Preservation Incentives</a>)</p><h3 id=special-tax-valuation>Special Tax Valuation<a class=anchor href=#special-tax-valuation>#</a></h3><p>Under <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.26">RCW 84.26</a>, owners of designated landmarks or contributing buildings in National Register or local historic districts can subtract approved rehabilitation costs from their assessed property value for up to 10 years. The rehabilitation must equal at least 25% of the assessed improvement value.

This can be combined with the state Special Tax Valuation.
