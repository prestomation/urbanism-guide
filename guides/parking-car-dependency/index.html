That ratio has dropped steadily from roughly 140 vehicles per 100 households in 2017. Between 2017 and 2023, the city added 35,000 new households but only about 3,300 cars.

Of these, about 522,000 are in parking garages, with on-street parking comprising slightly less than one-third of the total. The remainder is in surface lots and driveways. Seattle dedicates more land area to parking garages than comparable cities studied.

The <strong>Performance-Based Parking Pricing Program</strong> adjusts rates to target one to two open spaces per block at any given time.

Residents within an RPZ can purchase permits ($95 annually; $10 for income-eligible households) allowing them to park beyond posted time limits. Creating a new RPZ requires at least 10 connected blocks, with at least 35% of spaces occupied by non-residents.

The City Council added approximately 540 acres to areas exempt from parking minimums and reduced requirements by 50% across another 2,590 acres with frequent transit access. (<a href=https://council.seattle.gov/2012/05/10/removing-minimum-parking-requirements/>Seattle City Council</a>) Specifically:</p><ul><li><strong>Eliminated</strong> all off-street parking requirements for multifamily housing in high-density urban centers (downtown, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, Uptown, and the University District)</li><li><strong>Eliminated</strong> parking requirements in medium-density neighborhood centers (&ldquo;urban villages&rdquo;) within a quarter-mile of transit stops with at least 15-minute frequency</li><li><strong>Reduced</strong> parking minimums by 50% along major transit corridors within a quarter-mile of frequent transit stops</li></ul><p>A peer-reviewed study in <em>Land Use Policy</em> found that in areas affected by the reform, developers built 40% less parking than previously required — approximately 18,000 fewer spaces across 26,300 housing units built between 2012 and 2017. At an estimated $30,000 per space, the reform saved roughly $537 million in construction costs, or over $20,000 per unit. About 70% of developments with no parking requirement still chose to include some parking, indicating that the market — not the mandate — was driving parking decisions.

The legislation extended the 2012 reforms to additional locations and development types, further reducing parking requirements in areas served by frequent transit.

The Sightline Institute estimates that each mandated parking space adds approximately $200 per month to rent, regardless of whether the tenant owns a car.
