Priorities include opening 12 new park sites, renovating 5 community centers, reestablishing a Park Ranger program (adding 26 rangers), making all 129 restrooms available year-round, and beginning community center decarbonization.

Frontline neighborhoods like parts of Beacon Hill, Georgetown, and South Park have canopy coverage below 15%, compared to 40% or more in parts of North Seattle. Lower canopy correlates with higher heat-island temperatures, lower air quality, and greater health risks.
