The University of Washington&rsquo;s Racial Restrictive Covenants Project has documented more than <strong>50,000 racially restrictive covenants</strong> in western Washington. The first known Seattle covenant was written in 1923 by the Goodwin Company for tracts in Victory Heights. On Capitol Hill, nearly 1,000 homeowners added racial restrictions to existing deeds in a coordinated campaign in the late 1920s.

Over 57% of Homestead homeowners are households of color.</p><p><strong><a href=https://www.africatownlandtrust.org/>Africatown Community Land Trust</a></strong> (incorporated 2016) acquires and stewards land in Greater Seattle to preserve the Black community, particularly in the Central District.

The plan distributes growth more equitably: more new Neighborhood Centers are proposed where displacement risk is lower (northeast Seattle, Green Lake, Magnolia), while areas with high displacement risk receive a tailored approach encouraging preservation of existing homes. The plan roughly doubles the city&rsquo;s zoning capacity from approximately 165,000 to 330,000 units.

It requires seven state agencies — Ecology, Health, Agriculture, Commerce, Natural Resources, Transportation, and Puget Sound Partnership — to incorporate environmental justice into strategic plans, budget decisions, and significant agency actions. The law created an <strong>Environmental Justice Council</strong> (14 members appointed by the Governor) to provide oversight and recommendations.
