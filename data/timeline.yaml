  title: "One Seattle Comprehensive Plan Update"
  description: "Seattle adopts a major update to its comprehensive plan, allowing more housing types across the city, strengthening TOD requirements, and moving away from the urban village framework."
  legacy: "This is the biggest change to Seattle's land use framework in 30 years. It opens formerly single-family areas to duplexes, triplexes, and more, and sets the stage for station area planning around new light rail."

  legacy: "After a 76-year absence, streetcars returned to Capitol Hill and First Hill. Despite criticism for sharing lanes with cars and slow speeds, the line exceeded ridership projections within two years, averaging over 3,000 daily riders."

  description: "Seattle eliminates off-street parking requirements for multifamily housing in urban centers (downtown, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, Uptown, U District) and urban villages near high-frequency transit. Reduced requirements apply elsewhere."
  legacy: "Over five years, developers built 40% less parking than would otherwise have been required—nearly 18,000 fewer spaces across 26,300 units. The reform saved an estimated $537 million in construction costs and became a national model for parking reform."

  legacy: "Arguably the most consequential urbanist vote in Seattle's history. If Forward Thrust had passed, Seattle would have had a rail system decades earlier. The city's car-dependent development patterns of the 1970s-90s can be partially traced to this failure."

  legacy: "Seattle became the first U.S. city to rely largely on trackless trolleys. The streetcar tracks were torn up and sold for scrap. Had the system survived a few more months, WWII might have saved it—but the decision shaped 66 years of bus-only transit until the 2007 streetcar revival."

  legacy: "Within a month, 11,000 vehicles per day were using the bridge. It enabled development in north Seattle and established Aurora Avenue as a major commercial corridor. A time capsule installed by Judge Thomas Burke's widow is planned to be opened in 2032."

  legacy: "Seattle's muddy, treacherous roads made the streetcar an instant success. Downtown retailers had feared streetcars would frighten horse traffic, forcing Osgood to select 2nd Avenue instead of 1st. This began Seattle's streetcar era, which would last 57 years and shape the city's neighborhoods."
