  title: "The Bogue Plan"
  description: "Virgil Bogue proposes a grand civic plan for Seattle including a civic center, park system, and arterial highways. Voters reject it in 1912."
  legacy: "The rejection set a pattern: Seattle repeatedly struggles with big, centralized planning visions vs. incremental, neighborhood-driven change."

- year: 1928
  title: "First Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance"
  description: "Seattle adopts its first citywide zoning code, separating residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Single-family zones cover the vast majority of residential land."
  legacy: "This zoning framework -- with single-family dominance -- persisted largely unchanged for nearly a century and is the root of many current housing debates."

  title: "Yesler Terrace Opens"
  description: "Seattle's first public housing project opens. It was notably one of the first racially integrated public housing projects in the US."
  legacy: "Yesler Terrace was eventually redeveloped starting in 2013 into a mixed-income community, illustrating the evolution of public housing philosophy."

  title: "Century 21 Exposition (World's Fair)"
  description: "The Seattle World's Fair transforms Lower Queen Anne with the Space Needle, Monorail, and what becomes Seattle Center. The Monorail was intended as the start of a citywide system."
  legacy: "The Monorail's legacy is complicated -- it showed Seattle could build transit, but the 1.3-mile line became a symbol of unfulfilled transit ambitions. Subsequent monorail proposals failed."

  title: "Forward Thrust Transit Plan"
  description: "King County voters approve a regional transit plan including a 47-mile rail system. But it needed 60% approval for federal matching funds and got only 50.8%. The federal money went to Atlanta's MARTA instead."
  legacy: "Arguably the most consequential urbanist vote in Seattle's history. If Forward Thrust had passed, Seattle would have had a rail system decades earlier. The city's car-dependent development patterns of the 1970s-90s can be partially traced to this failure."

- year: 1970
  title: "Freeway Revolts"
  description: "Community activism stops planned freeways through the Central District, Ravenna, and along the waterfront (R.H. Thomson Expressway and Bay Freeway). Seattle removes the planned routes from its plans."
  legacy: "The freeway revolts saved several neighborhoods from destruction and established a pattern of community resistance to highway expansion that continues today (see: waterfront tunnel, I-5 lid proposals)."

- year: 1990
  title: "Growth Management Act (GMA)"
  description: "Washington State passes the Growth Management Act, requiring cities to plan for growth within urban growth boundaries and protect rural land."
  legacy: "The GMA is why Seattle must grow *up* rather than *out*. It's the legal foundation for comprehensive planning, urban growth boundaries, and the density debates that define Seattle urbanism."

- year: 1994
  title: "Seattle's Comprehensive Plan & Urban Villages"
  description: "Seattle adopts a comprehensive plan organizing growth around 'urban villages' -- designated neighborhood centers where density is directed. Most residential land remains single-family."
  legacy: "The urban village strategy shaped 30 years of development, concentrating apartments and mixed-use in corridors while protecting single-family neighborhoods. The 2024 comp plan update finally moves away from this framework."

- year: 1996
  title: "Sound Transit Created"
  description: "Voters approve Sound Move (later called ST1), creating Sound Transit and funding the first light rail line, commuter rail (Sounder), and express buses."
  legacy: "After decades of failed transit proposals, this vote finally committed the region to building rail. Everything in Seattle's current transit expansion traces back to this decision."

- year: 2003
  title: "Seattle Monorail Project Approved and Collapsed"
  description: "Voters approve a citywide monorail plan for the fourth time, but the Seattle Monorail Project collapses in 2005 due to cost overruns and financing problems."
  legacy: "The monorail failure made Seattle voters skeptical of transit proposals for years and reinforced Sound Transit's position as the region's transit builder."

- year: 2009
  title: "Link Light Rail Opens"
  description: "Sound Transit's Central Link light rail opens between downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport. The first segment of what would become the region's rail backbone."
  legacy: "Link light rail fundamentally changed development patterns along its route. The Rainier Valley, Capitol Hill, and University District all saw significant development driven by station access."

- year: 2014
  title: "$15 Minimum Wage"
  description: "Seattle passes a landmark $15/hour minimum wage, the first major US city to do so."
  legacy: "While not strictly an urbanism issue, the minimum wage law reflected Seattle's progressive politics and its grappling with affordability as a growing, expensive city."

- year: 2015
  title: "Vision Zero Adopted"
  description: "Seattle commits to eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The plan prioritizes investments on high-crash corridors and emphasizes engineering over enforcement."
  legacy: "Despite the commitment, traffic deaths have increased since adoption. Vision Zero remains important as a policy framework advocates use to push for safer streets."

- year: 2016
  title: "ST3 Approved"
  description: "Voters approve Sound Transit 3, a $54 billion expansion including light rail to Ballard, West Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah."
  legacy: "ST3 will define the region's urban form for decades. Station locations are already driving development patterns and zoning discussions, even before lines open."

- year: 2019
  title: "MHA and ADU Reforms"
  description: "Seattle implements Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) with upzones in many neighborhoods. ADU/DADU rules are also loosened, allowing backyard cottages on most single-family lots."
  legacy: "MHA was the first significant upzoning across Seattle in decades. Combined with ADU reforms, it began to chip away at single-family exclusivity -- a process the 2024 comp plan accelerated dramatically."

- year: 2023
  title: "Social Housing Initiative (I-135)"
  description: "Seattle voters approve Initiative 135, creating a new public development authority to build mixed-income social housing (not means-tested, cross-subsidized)."
  legacy: "The Social Housing Developer represents a new model for Seattle -- publicly developed housing that serves a range of incomes. It's still early, but it could become a significant housing tool."

- year: 2024
  title: "One Seattle Comprehensive Plan Update"
  description: "Seattle adopts a major update to its comprehensive plan, allowing more housing types across the city, strengthening TOD requirements, and moving away from the urban village framework."
  legacy: "This is the biggest change to Seattle's land use framework in 30 years. It opens formerly single-family areas to duplexes, triplexes, and more, and sets the stage for station area planning around new light rail."
